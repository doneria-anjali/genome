Washington: Sorry, Steve Running, Wildfires Are Decreasing with Global Warming

LENGTH: 560  words

DATELINE: Washington


The Heartland Institute has issued the following news release:

A Billings Gazette article last week quoted University of Montana global warming
activist Steve Running claiming major wildfires have quadrupled since 1986, but
the facts show wildfires are actually declining.

In the September 7 Gazette article, "Global warming makes firefighting more
dangerous," Running is quoted saying "Since 1986, longer, warmer summers have
resulted in a fourfold increase of major wildfires and a sixfold increase in the
area of forest burned, compared to the period from 1970 to 1986." Fortunately
for scientific truth, the National Interagency Fire Center keeps detailed
statistics on wildfires going back to 1960. The objective data show wildfires
are decreasing, not increasing, as the planet modestly warms.

The National Interagency Fire Center reports 85,000 wildfires occurred in 1986,
versus only 47,000 wildfires last year. Fewer wildfires occurred in 2013 than
any year since 1984, and 2013 had the third-fewest wildfires since records began
in 1960.

This year's wildfire season may end up being even quieter than 2013. On the same
day Running's claim was quoted in the Billings Gazette article, the Washington
Times reported only 38,000 wildfires have occurred so far this year. The 2014
wildfire season will almost certainly be one of the three quietest since 1984,
and may well end up quietest of them all.

So how does Running justify his claim that global warming is making wildfires
worse? Running cleverly slips in the term "major" wildfires, which allows him to
blame global warming for recent forestry management policies that allow small
wildfires to become large wildfires. During recent years, U.S. wildfire policy
has emphasized allowing wildfires to burn without human suppression until and
unless the wildfires threaten human population centers. This is a dramatic
change of policy after decades of government policy to extinguish wildfires
whenever and wherever they occur. Accordingly, even though there were
approximately half as many wildfires in 2013 as in 1986, the total number of
acres burned increased by more than 50 percent in 2013.

If one conveniently ignores the extremely quiet 2013 and 2014 wildfire seasons
and compares 1986 to 2012, wildfires in 2012 burned nearly four times as much
acreage in 1986, but there were fewer wildfires in 2012 than in 1986.

The National Interagency Fire Center data show an even more striking decline in
wildfires when comparing the full 1970-1986 era versus the full 1986-2013 era.
True, the number of acres burned each year, according to the National
Interagency Fire Center, was approximately 67 percent higher during 1987-2013
than during 1970-1986 (though substantially less than the 600 percent figure
claimed by Running), but even this small increase in acres burned merely
reflects changes in federal wildfire suppression policy. Barely half as many
wildfires occurred each year from 1987-2013 than from 1970-1986.

Outlandish and misleading claims by global warming alarmists such as Running
explain why the public increasingly tunes out the alarmists' unending
predictions of doom and gloom. If they want people to take them seriously, they
must begin speaking truth rather than propaganda.

BURNING BLAZE What are wildfires, how do they start, why do they spread so
quickly and where have the worst ones struck this year?;
Wildfires will destroy anything in its path if given fuel to feed it

BYLINE: By Amanda Devlin

SECTION: NEWS; Version:3

LENGTH: 480 words


BATTLING a wildfire with fierce ferocity and intensity is like trying to stop a
tornado.

But what exactly is a wildfire and how does it start?

What is a wildfire?

A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire, which can burn for days or even weeks.

At its worst, wildfires can wipe out entire forests - killing everything in its
path.

They also have significant impacts on visibility, air quality and health.

How does a wildfire start?

Four out of five wildfires are started by people, with nature there to help fan
the flames.

There are three key things needed to make it start initially, which firefighters
call the fire triangle.

A wildfire needs fuel, oxygen, and a heat source.

Dry weather helps to turn grass into a flammable fuel, with the winds carrying
it across land and a warm sun encouraging combustion.

The trio creates the spark needed to set a wildfire off - which in some cases
could last for weeks.

Common causes of wildfires include, lightning, campfires, smoking, burning
debris, fireworks or arson.

Why do they spread so quickly?

A raging blaze can be hard to stop because a wildfire can be be driven by winds,
slopes or fuel.

Combine all three and it makes it a very dangerous situation.

If the ground is very dry, it can also make the fire extremely difficult to
contain.

Where are they most likely to happen ?

Wildfires can start anywhere, but are most common in the forested areas of
America and Canada.

Vegetated areas of Australia as well as in the Western Cape of South Africa are
also at risk.

On October 9, a raging inferno swept though California killing 41 people.

It burnt 213,000 acres and destroyed 5,700 structures.

What are some of the worst wildfires of 2017?

June 2017: A massive wildfire tore across Ibiza

June 2017: Devastating wildfires in Portugal left at least 62 dead

July 2017: Thousands evacuated from path of wildfires in Santa Barbara,
California

July 2017: Wildfires ripped through the French Riviera forcing hundreds to
evacuate

August 2017: A wildfire blazed across Portugal after the devastating Lucifer
heatwave

August 2017: Wildfires raged on the Greek party island of Zante for more than
four days

September 2017: The 5,000-acre La Tuna Fire led authorities to evacuate more
than 700 homes

September 2017: A wildfire, believed to have been started by a firework, ripped
through Oregon, Canada triggering mass evacuations

October 2017: The deadly Cascade wildfire tore through California

October 2017: Fires which broke out across the border in Spain's Galicia region
quickly proved deadly

October 2017: An apocalyptic wildfire raged in Portugal's Iberian peninsula

December 2017: Wildfires tore through California destroying hundreds of homes
and sparking the evacuation of thousands

Washington: Fire Statistics Debunk Asserted Link to Global Warming

LENGTH: 303  words

DATELINE: Washington


The Heartland Institute has issued the following news release:


California Gov. Jerry Brown blamed global warming for recent wildfires in
California, but objective data show a decline in wildfires as our planet
modestly warms.

2013 was one of the quietest wildfire years in U.S. history, according to data
from the federal government's National Interagency Fire Center. The 47,000
wildfires last year may seem like a very large number - and it certainly gives
global warming alarmists like Brown plenty of fodder for misleading claims - but
the 47,000 wildfires was less than half the average number of wildfires that
occurred each year in the 1960s and 1970s. Earth was cooling during the 1960s
and 1970s when so many more wildfires occurred.

The unusually quiet 2013 fire season continued a long-term trend in declining
wildfires. From 1962 through 1982, for example, at least 100,000 wildfires
occurred in the United States every year. Since 1982, however, not a single year
has registered 100,000 wildfires. During the past decade, an average of 73,000
wildfires occurred each year. During the 1970s, by contrast, an average of
155,000 wildfires occurred each year.

The 2014 wildfire season, moreover, has been relatively quiet so far. The total
number of wildfires is well below the 1962-2013 average and is even below the
average for the past decade. Even so, the below-average 22,000 wildfires so far
this year give alarmists plenty of opportunities to mislead the public about the
facts.

Droughts and wildfires have always occurred and will always occur. While global
warming is reducing the frequency of droughts and wildfires, warming will not
completely eradicate droughts and wildfires. They will continue from time to
time despite their long-term decline.

OPINION;
We created the province's wildfire problem - and we can fix it

BYLINE: LORI DANIELS, ROERT GRAY, DAVID OWMAN

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. S1

LENGTH: 868 words


Wildfire has become a wicked problem - as witnessed in British Columbia this
week as intense and fast-moving wildfires have driven 14,000 people from their
homes and prompted a state of emergency. In the past 15 years, high-intensity
wildfires have burned through forests altered by mountain pine beetle or decades
of fire suppression, often threatening communities that are expanding into
wildlands. Wildfire seasons are beginning earlier and summer droughts are more
pronounced, likely enhanced by global climate change. Given the extent of
forests in B.C.'s mountainous terrain, most communities are at risk of burning
during a wildfire.

Understanding the cause and consequences of this problem is essential to find
meaningful solutions.

The common misconceptions that all wildfires are destructive, should be
controlled and can be suppressed have created unrealistic expectations and are
barriers to meaningful solutions.

Ecologists know wildfire is an essential component of our ecosystems; most
Canadians, however, have a limited appreciation of the benefits of wildfire.
Wildfires rejuvenate forests and create habitats essential for biodiversity.

In the absence of wildfire, landscapes become uniformly susceptible to damaging
fires and insect outbreaks.

Public aversion to all wildfire has been reinforced by a very successful policy
of suppressing nearly all wildfires in recent decades. An unintended consequence
of suppression has been to increase forest densities and fuel loads in the dry
forests of B.C., making them more susceptible to severe fire that is difficult
to control and may threaten human communities - a phenomenon known as the
firesuppression paradox.

Simultaneously, urban sprawl into wildlands throughout the province exacerbates
this problem. The expanding wildlandurban interface poses an enormously
challenging firemanagement problem. Many homeowners are unaware of the risk they
face from wildfire, erroneously believing fire is an improbable,
once-in-a-lifetime event so they see no reason to reduce forest fuels
surrounding their homes and communities.

Innovations such as fighting fire with fire may seem counterintuitive, but is a
critical part of the solution to the urgent and growing wildfire problem. In
recent years, many wildfires have exceeded modern suppression technology at
tremendous economic, social and ecological costs. Long-term solutions must
include managed wildfires - a variant of fire suppression also known as
"modified response" - as well as prescribed fires. Under managed wildfire, the
strategy is to let wildfires burn if they are of low risk to life and property.

Managed wildfires, as well as prescribed fires, are key to restoring fire into
naturally flammable landscapes and an effective mechanism to reduce fuel loads
and risk of subsequent uncontrollable fires. Closer to communities and critical
infrastructure, wildfire risk can be reduced by thinning forests or prescribing
fire to manage fuels.

Reducing wildfire threats to homes and communities is a shared responsibility.
Meaningful and effective solutions to wildfire threats are well known, but have
proven difficult to implement.

The Filmon Report, written in the wake of the 2003 wildfires that devastated
several communities in B.C., detailed pro-active and integrated forest and fire
management necessary to prevent a repeat of catastrophic wildfires in B.C. Over
the past decade, we have seen several positive developments, but there are still
significant barriers preventing solutions to safeguard many communities.
Hazardous fuels, the chief culprit in the wildfire problem, are still
accumulating and have yet to be treated at the appropriate scale. High treatment
cost is a limiting factor, but economies of scale could be realized through
forest policy changes, such as tenure reform. Bioenergy is a promising outlet
for the lowvalue biomass resulting from forest thinning, but incentives to make
bioenergy co-exist with traditional forest products are lacking. Debate over
responsibility for treating thousands of hectares of hazardous fuels on Crown
land is a major impediment to safeguarding communities. The province of B.C.
insists local governments should be the lead to address interface fuel hazards,
but many communities lack the legal mandate, expertise and capacity to take on
such a monumental task. Outstanding programs such as "Fire Smart" enable
homeowners to assess the level of threat facing their property, but resources to
help address threats remain minimal.

For many communities in B.C., it is not if, but when, wildfire will pose a
threat. The necessary home renovations, forest thinning and other mitigation
activities require substantive, sustained funding so they can be applied
consistently across large areas to ultimately make forests and communities
resilient.

Leadership and investments from the provincial government are urgently needed to
overcome these barriers and enable solutions to safeguard our communities.

Washington: Schrader, Simpson Reintroduce Wildfire Disaster Funding Act

LENGTH: 676  words




Washington: Office of the MP Kurt Schrader has issued the following news
release:

Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson and Oregon Congressman Kurt Schrader today
reintroduced the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act (WDFA), legislation which would
fix the current budgeting process for wildfires.


In recent years, Congress has budgeted for wildfire suppression by appropriating
money according to the average cost for wildfires over the past ten years, known
as the "ten-year average."  When costs exceed an agency's fire budget, that
agency is forced to borrow from non-fire accounts to pay for fire suppression.
This practice is known as "fire-borrowing." Robbing these accounts means that
the Forest Service and other land management agencies have fewer resources
available for forest management activities like hazardous fuels reduction that
would prevent catastrophic fires.  As a result, fires get worse and wildfire
suppression costs end up devouring the agency's budget.
"I have seen the cost of wildfires in Idaho and the impacts it has on our
forests when funds that are planned for forest management are used to fight
wildfires," said Simpson. "When more than fifty percent of an agency's budget is
unpredictable, you are creating a recipe for the unsustainable fire-borrowing we
see today that devastates our forests and costs taxpayers. I am pleased to
reintroduce the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act with Congressman Schrader again
this Congress. It is time to acknowledge that catastrophic wildfires should be
funded like natural disasters so we can ensure that land managers have the
resources they need to properly manage our forests."
"Simply put, the current system is broken," said Schrader. "Because we do no
project management to help protect our forests, we end up paying much more to
fight costly carbon producing wildfires that again devastate our ability to do
the critical forest management on our public lands in the first place. These
fires should be treated the same as any other natural disaster. Budgeting to
address the mismanagement of our forests would free up financial resources. Our
bill will work to fix this root problem by reducing fuel loads, improving forest
health, save taxpayers money, and provide jobs in our struggling rural
communities."
Fire borrowing was intended to be an extraordinary measure to help in bad
wildfire years. However, this practice has become the norm and not the
exception, which has caused wildfire costs to increase. According to the Forest
Service, wildfire costs were 56% of their total budget in 2016. In 1995, the
Forest Service spent only 16% of their total budget fighting wildfires. By 2025,
that number could increase to nearly 70% if nothing is done to fix the budgeting
process.
The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would end fire borrowing by treating wildfires
like other natural disasters when wildfire suppression costs are exhausted. Most
importantly, the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would protect land management
programs by protecting the budget from the increasing ten-year average. Wildfire
suppression would still be funded through the normal budgeting and
appropriations process, but when the Forest Service exceeds its annual wildfire
suppression budget, the agency would be able to fund wildfire fighting costs
like other natural disasters. This allows the Forest Service and other land
management agencies to maintain resources in the prevention accounts they are
intended for, ultimately preventing catastrophic wildfires from growing in size
and cost.
The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act was also introduced in the 113th and 114th
Congress. The legislation received 150 bipartisan cosponsors and the support of
more than 300 organizations. Original cosponsors for the Wildfire Disaster
Funding Act of 2017 include Representatives Mark Amodei, Suzanne Bonamici, Ken
Calvert, Jim Costa, Peter DeFazio, Marcy Kaptur, Derek Kilmer, Raul Labrador,
Betty McCollum, Cathy McMorris-Rodgers, Dan Newhouse, Jared Polis, Kysrten
Sinema, Steve Stivers, Scott Tipton, and Greg Walden.

intended for, ultimately preventing catastrophic wildfires from growing in size
and cost.
The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act was also introduced in the 113th and 114th
Congress. The legislation received 150 bipartisan cosponsors and the support of
more than 300 organizations. Original cosponsors for the Wildfire Disaster
Funding Act of 2017 include Representatives Mark Amodei, Suzanne Bonamici, Ken
Calvert, Jim Costa, Peter DeFazio, Marcy Kaptur, Derek Kilmer, Raul Labrador,
Betty McCollum, Cathy McMorris-Rodgers, Dan Newhouse, Jared Polis, Kysrten
Sinema, Steve Stivers, Scott Tipton, and Greg Walden.

Girls U15

The U15 West Coast Wildfire girls claimed the championship at the 2014 Magic
Cup. The Wildfire, a National Premier League (NPL) soccer team, capped off their
summer tournament season with four consecutive wins.

The Wildfire faced Central Valley Crossfire in a hard-fought championship match.
Both teams were determined to bring home the championship but the Wildfire
outlasted the Crossfire thanks to stingy defense and a timely goal.

In the first half, goalie Nicole Pastrikas, recorded several acrobatic saves for
the Wildfire and kept the game tied at 0-0. In the second half, Wildfire forward
Jenna Zuniga scored the lone goal with a great individual effort on a breakaway.

"I'm very proud of this young Wildfire team, they consistently absorb
information and execute their individual and team tasks. This young team is
rapidly becoming one of the top U15 teams in Northern California," said Wildfire
coach Troy Dayak.

In the semifinal match, the Wildfire faced a longtime rival, Walnut Creek Storm.
West Coast forward Meghan Giamona was player of the game. Giamona scored the
first goal of the game and followed that up with a perfectly placed free kick
just outside the 18 for a 2-0 Wildfire lead. Forward Jenna Zuniga scored an
insurance goal to cap the scoring, and the Wildfire held on for a 4-1 victory.

In the second game of bracket play, the Wildfire faced Sacramento United,
another NPL team from Sacramento. The Wildfire came out strong and scored first
on a corner kick from Meghan Giamona. The second score came from another corner
kick, which was headed in by forward Tori Diehl. In the second half, the
Wildfire took a 3-0 lead when forward Paola Samaniego scored on a breakaway.

In a battle of top teams from Northern California, the Wildfire first faced East
Bay-Bay Oaks. The Wildfire scored first with a solid shot from forward Tory
Borgna. By halftime, the Wildfire held a 2-0 lead. The third and final goal came
from midfielder Mayzin Kung, who found the net from inside 18 feet. The victory
gave the Wildfire their first of four wins, along with the top seed in bracket
play.

The Wildfire will now begin their regular NPL season playing matches against
Northern California's top teams. Follow the West Coast Wildfire and other West

Community Wildfire Protection Plans strengthening partnerships between local
governments and landowners to help reduce wildfire risk;
FENDING THE FLAMES

BYLINE: Teresa Stepzinski

SECTION: Pg. A-1

LENGTH: 1568 words


Robert Odom knows fire can be a friend or an enemy. The difference can be a
stray ember riding the wind and landing in a pile of dry pine needles.

Owning about 655 acres including timber, pasture and dried-up wetlands in
Keystone Heights, Odom uses periodic prescribed burns and 12-foot-wide fire
breaks around the perimeter of his ranch as well as several fire breaks through
the interior of the property to make it more defensible against wildfire. In
addition, Odom cuts down "non-productive sand pine trees," which shed flammable
needles and pinecones.

Odom of Fernandina Beach learned such precautions as a child from his
grandparents - farmers who used a controlled burn about every year to clear
fallen pine needles and brush that would feed a wildfire. About 17 years ago,
before Odom bought the Keystone Heights ranch, a wildfire on neighboring land
spread and burned 200 acres on what would become Odom's tract.

To keep that from happening again, Odom went to the Florida Forest Service for
help with prescribed burns and advice on fire breaks and other precautions.

"That seems to work out pretty doggone well," Odom said of the wildfire
-mitigation burns, which he does about every two years. The fire breaks,
meanwhile, are a line of defense that could keep a blaze from running onto his
property.

The wet spring so far has dampened Northeast Florida's wildfire risk. However,
landowners like Odom as well as state and county officials are taking
precautions to prevent the blazes and to reduce the threat of property damage
and harm to life should a fire start.

Wildfires occur throughout the year in Florida. Typically, Northeast Florida
sees the most in April, May and June, especially June because of "dry
lightning."

Clay County commissioners April 22 adopted a countywide Community Wildfire
Protection Plan developed by the state Forest Service in collaboration with
county Emergency Management and Fire Rescue.

The plan's in-depth analysis of the county's wildfire vulnerability identifies
Clay's resources to respond to wildfires - its mutual aid pacts with the state
and neighboring governments, its partnerships with landowners, its plans and the
steps taken to reduce wildfire risk.

Effective partnerships with other agencies and landowners, have proved vital
over the years, said Clay Fire Chief Lorin Mock.

In 2012, a Keystone Heights lake bed fire sparked by an illegal burn destroyed
one home, damaged another structure and forced evacuations as it charred about
150 acres. Clay fought that blaze with help from the state as well as Duval,
Flagler and St. Johns counties for two weeks. In turn, Clay has assisted those
agencies, Mock said.

People cause most of the wildfires in Clay, Baker and Bradford counties, the
result of reckless or malicious intentional burning of lands. Fires ignited by
escaping burning debris and those started by lightning are the second and third
most-frequent causes, according to the wildfire protection plans.

About 69 percent of Clay County's 508,825 acres could be classified as "having
moderate to high wildfire risk." Wildfires started by people account for 82
percent of all Clay County's wildfires and 67 percent of the total acres burned,
according to the plan.

Last year, 34 wildfires burned about 50 acres in Clay. However, 60 wildfires
charred 765 acres in 2012, while there were 91 fires that burned 991 acres
during 2011 in Clay, forest service data show.

"I think that most of it is, nobody goes out with the intention of burning down
their neighbor's property. They go out with the intention of doing some moderate
controlled burn and land clearing, but then because of conditions, it gets out
of control," Mock said.

However, people also are a linchpin in preventing wildfires. Creating a
defensible space around their property, and only burning legally during proper
weather conditions, will go a long way to help prevent wildfires, Mock said.

"Realistically, homeowners make that choice when they strike that match to
conduct that burn," Mock said.

Bradford and Baker counties each have county-wide Community Wildfire Protection
Plans. Putnam County's plan is nearly complete. Nassau County will start its
plan this year, followed by Duval County, said Annaleasa Winter, state Forest
Service wildfire mitigation specialist.

Baker County's plan, adopted in September 2012, is being updated. The sparsely
populated county is susceptible to wildfires largely because of federal and
state forest lands, which account for 44 percent of the county's 374,534 acres -
or almost 260 square miles. About 85 percent of all the county's wildfires are
caused by people, its wildfire protection plan shows.

County Fire Chief Steve Marfongella wants to expand countywide the Firewise
Communities Program wildfire prevention program, which now exists only in
Taylor, an unincorporated community near the John M. Bethea State Forest. That
program's priority includes creating a defensible space of 30 to 100 feet wide
around all buildings that is free of brush, debris or other flammable materials,
he said.

"Basically, it gives us a fighting chance to protect a home," said Marfongella,
adding they have field mowers and a chipper for use in the Firewise program,
which has been well-received in Taylor.

Marfongella said the most important thing people should know is they can protect
their homes and other property. "Help us help you. Give us a defensible space so
we can get in there and protect the home, and make sure we have driveway
access," he said.

St. Johns Fire Rescue established its own Wildland Fire Management Team program
two years ago. Its personnel have advanced training in wildfire behavior,
response tactics and the preparation necessary to combat them. Wildfire
prevention information is provided to the public as part of the Fire Rescue
department's regular public awareness/education program, said Lt. Jeremy
Robshaw, a fire rescue spokesman.

"We have always been very aggressive in our wildland firefighting, and in
support of Florida Forest Service," said Robshaw, explaining they are prepared
"to ramp up our response, add additional personnel and have trucks stationed at
specific areas ready to respond" should brush fires break out.

The Forest Service is working with St. Johns to develop a countywide community
wildfire protection plan, said Timber Weller, a Forest Service wildfire
mitigation specialist.

Bradford County's 188,160 acres are vulnerable to wildfires largely because
about a third of it is forest. Another 7,300 acres in the Santa Fe Swamp
Wildlife and Environmental Area is susceptible.

Brian Johns, county emergency management director, is working with the County
Commission to require each new subdivision to be better prepared for fires. So
far, Lakewood, a small neighborhood in central Bradford County, is Bradford's
only Firewise Community. That program, Johns said, has been very effective in
that the residents have embraced the practice of creating defensible space
around their homes and the community as a whole.

The partnership between the residents, homeowners association, forest service
and county has resulted in an annual community workday in which trees are
trimmed, brush is mowed, and roofs and gutters cleared of fallen leaves, Johns
said.

"That has been very successful for Lakewood in keeping the wildfire risk down
... and we'd like to get more of that in the county," Johns said.

Firefighter brings new skills and expertise to county after battling fires in US

BYLINE: Caroline Lewis

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 449 words


A brave member of Dorset and Wiltshire fire crews is bringing new expertise to
the county after battling fires in the US.

Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service Watch Manager Andy Elliott returned
from California after spending three weeks working alongside Middletown crews of
Cal Fire.

The US State of California recently declared a state of emergency after being
gripped by some of the worst wildfires in recent history.

Andy is one of only 12 Wildlife Tactical Advisors for the UK and has been
travelling to California since 2015 after his expertise and training was called
upon to help tackle the infamous, Valley Fire.

The fire became the most destructive fire in California's history, burning
across over 76,000 acres, destroying nearly 2,000 homes and claiming the lives
of at least four people.

During his first two weeks with the Middletown crews, Andy attended several
incidents including four structure fires, many medical incidents and several
wildfires.

Andy received training on their unique equipment and learnt new wildfire
techniques as well as completing his USA wildfire qualifications.

But wildfires are not limited to the United States or Continental Europe.
Conditions during the summer months, especially across the heathland and plains
of Dorset and Wiltshire, often lend themselves to wildfires.

Andy said: "Climate change predictions are suggesting that we may see more
extreme wildfire conditions in the UK. Southern Europe has suffered its most
destructive wildfire season ever and this is slowly coming our way.

"It is important that UK firefighters learn lessons from other parts of the
world to help us prepare for our own wildfires."

To raise awareness and to discuss how we can prepare for wildfires in the UK,
Andy and Dorset County Council are organising this year's UK Wildfires
Conference in Bournemouth on November 7 and 8.

The theme for this year's conference is Wildfire Mitigation in a UK Context. The
biennial conference, hosted by Dorset's Urban Heaths Partnership, and overseen
by the England and Wales Wildfire Forum and the Scottish Wildfire Forum, will
bring together wildfire practitioners from all over the UK and beyond.

Chief Fire Officer Ben Ansell from Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service,
said: "In light of the recent wildfire tragedies around the world, it is
appropriate for key stakeholders within the UK to review our position on
wildfires, to ensure that we are well-prepared to meet the challenges posed by
our present and future climate and fuels."

Operation WildFire to investigate recent countryside arson

LENGTH: 808  words


A new joint operation to investigate hundreds of wildfires started deliberately
in Northern Ireland's countryside last month has been launched.

Operation WildFire brings together experts from the Northern Ireland Environment
Agency (NIEA) the PSNI and the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS)
to investigate in more depth a number of the recent wildfires. They will be
assisted by a team of international wildfire investigators from the European
Forest Institute and European Forest Risk Facility (FRISK).

Many of the recent fires spread rapidly due to the dry ground conditions,
putting the public, property, firefighters and important habitats and species at
risk.

The initial work of Operation WildFire will be to determine the origin of a
number of the recent fires and their causes.

This is an essential first step in any successful fire investigation and can
help lead to prosecutions should the fires be shown to be caused by human
action.

Welcoming the new joint operation, Colum McDaid who leads on wildfire control
initiatives in NIEA said: "The vigorous and thorough investigation of wildfires
is the key to catching arsonists, and can be critical in identifying serial
arsonists before they can move on to bigger targets.

"The law states that burning of vegetation such as heather, gorse, whin or fern
must not be carried out between April 15th and August 31th, and only carried out
at other times of the year under controlled and expert supervision. Additional
offences can be caused by fires that impact on designated sites such as Areas of
Special Scientific Interest and their features. Landowners are required to
obtain consent from DAERA for prescribed burning within designated sites."

Constable Darryl Johnston, operational planning PSNI added: "Wildfires are
illegal and the deliberate setting of wildfires is a criminal offence. We hope
to use the Operation Wildfire investigations to determine the cause and origin
of a number of the recent fires with the ultimate aim of serving in court cases
and deterring arsonists.

"If members of the public have information about anyone who has started
wildfires, please let the PSNI know so that we can pursue them through the
courts. Not only do these fires cause widespread damage to our precious
countryside, but they can also put lives at risk."

Also welcoming the joint operation, Mark Smyth station commander and NIFRS lead
officer for Wildfires said: "NIFRS attended 983 gorse fires in May 2017, 801 of
which took place from the first to May 12th alone. More than 90% of these gorse
fires were started deliberately, but given the nature of the fires and their
rapid spread, identifying the exact origin and cause of the fire while actively
fighting the fires has been difficult.

"We look forward to working alongside our partner agencies and the wildfire
investigators from the European Forest Risk Facility as we visit the sites of
some of the larger gorse fires we dealt with including Slieve Beagh in Clogher
and Mullaghcarn in Omagh. This will be an invaluable opportunity to learn about
the latest wildfire investigation techniques."

Advice about wildfires

The messages about the impacts of wildfires and how to avoid them are clear and
simple.

* Wildfires are not natural - they are almost always started by humans either
deliberately or by being careless

* Wildfires put lives at risk - they could result in tragedy for people caught
in the line of fire. Dealing with these types of incidents puts not only
firefighters' lives at risk but the lives of everyone in the local community.
Firefighters are diverted from other emergencies and contingency plans have to
be put in place to ensure continued emergency cover for towns and villages
across Northern Ireland - this may result in a slight delay when responding.

* Wildfires cost everyone - the whole community, as well as businesses that
provide much needed employment. Between 2005 and 2010, £35 million was spent on
fighting wildfires alone.

* Wildfires destroy our surroundings - how they look and the wildlife in them

* Wildfires are illegal - deliberate setting of wildfires is a criminal offence.

If you are in the countryside:

* Extinguish cigarettes and other smoking materials properly; Never throw
cigarette ends out of car windows; only use barbecues in designated areas and
never leave them unattended;

* Ensure that barbecues are fully extinguished and cold before disposing of
their contents;

* Avoid using open fires in the countryside;

* Do not leave bottles or glass behind; sunlight shining through glass can start
a fire.

If you see a fire:

* If you see a fire in the countryside, report it immediately to the Fire and
Rescue Service;

* Do not attempt to tackle fires that cannot be put out with a bucket of water;

* Leave the area as soon as possible;

* If you see someone setting fires, report it to the PSNI

How climate change is increasing forest fires around the world

BYLINE: Deutsche Welle

LENGTH: 1201 words


Have wildfires increased globally over recent years? And if so, is global
warming to blame? Research has illuminated this, along with what wildfires do to
us and our environment, and which areas are most vulnerable.Are wildfires
increasing around the world?

Unusually large wildfires ravaged Alaska and Indonesia in 2015. The following
year, Canada, California and Spain were devastated by uncontrolled flames. In
2017, massive fires devastated regions of Chile - and now, a deadly blaze in
Portugal has claimed dozens of lives.

So, have wildfires actually increased globally, or does it just seem that way
because we're tuned in more to bad news and social media?

Science suggests that over the past few decades, the number of wildfires has
indeed increased, especially in the western United States. According to the
Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), every state in the western US has
experienced an increase in the average annual number of large wildfires over
past decades.

Extensive studies have found that large forest fires in the western US have been
occurring nearly five times more often since the 1970s and 80s. Such fires are
burning more than six times the land area as before, and lasting almost five
times longer.

What's more, wildfire season - meaning seasons with higher wildfire potential -
has universally become longer over the past 40 years.

This trend is something Jason Funk, senior climate scientist with UCS, is very
worried about.

"2015 was a record-breaking year in the US, with more than 10 million acres
burned," he told DW in an interview. "That's about 4 million hectares, or an
area of the size of the Netherlands or Switzerland."

"It's a scale we haven't seen in recent history and it's very concerning."

According to Funk, not only US forests are endangered by increasing wildfires -
the trend has been that wildfires are burning more area around the world.

"In recent years, there have been big fires in Siberia and various other places
around the world where we typically don't see large-scale wildfires," he said.

Projections by the UCS suggest that wildfires could get four, five and even six
times as bad as they currently are within this century.

What is the main reason wildfires are increasing?

Funk has been researching the impact of climate change on landscapes in the US,
and says there is very well documented scientific evidence that climate change
has been increasing the length of the fire season, the size of the area burned
each year and the number of wildfires.

Wildfires are typically either started accidentally by humans - such as a
burning cigarette carelessly tossed out of a window - or by natural causes like
lightning.

These "ignition events" don't have a major effect on the scale of the fire, says
Funk. But what does affect scale are prevailing climate conditions. And these
have become warmer and drier - due to climate change.

Greenhouse gas emissions, via the greenhouse effect, are causing the global
temperature to increase and the climate to change. This enhances the likelihood
of wildfires.

Why? Because warmer temperatures increase evaporation, which means the
atmosphere draws more moisture from soils, making the land drier.

A warmer climate also leads to earlier snowmelt, which causes soils to be drier
for longer. And dry soils become more susceptible to fire.

"The areas where wildfires are taking place are always areas that [have become]
drier and hotter, and where spring has come earlier," said Funk.

Drier conditions and higher temperatures increase not only the likelihood of a
wildfire to occur, but also the duration and the severity of the wildfire.

That means when wildfires break out, they expand faster and burn more area as
they move in unpredictable ways. "They really take off and get out of control
more frequently than in the past," said Funk.

What else is increasing wildfires?

A less direct climate-driven effect is pest outbreaks that have killed a lot of
trees. Pests make forests more susceptible to wildfire, according to Funk.

"We know that these pest outbreaks have been caused by climate change, because
there hasn't been anything like that in the past 500 years, perhaps even 1,000
years," he said.

Insects are responding to warmer conditions, Funk explained, taking advantage of
the longer summer season which grants them longer breeding circles and faster
reproduction. "We can link those effects to the warmer temperatures that we've
seen in the places where wildfires have been taking place."

While human activities such as logging and mining are known to influence the
likelihood of wildfires as well, many of the areas that have seen recent
increases in wildfires are relatively unaffected by human land use.

This suggests that climate change is a major factor driving the increase in
fires, according to UCS.

What threats do these wildfires pose?

Forest fires aren't necessarily bad. In fact, fire is a natural and beneficial
part of many forest ecosystems, and we need to allow some fires to burn, as they
are necessary for the ecosystems to stay healthy.

Over the decades, undergrowth builds up on the forest floor - so when a fire
burns through, that provides space for larger, more mature trees that are more
fire-resistant.

But the unnatural increase in wildfires is causing entire forests to burn down
uncontrollably. This is bad for the environment - and for us.

Wildfires pose risks to human life, property and infrastructure - recent
wildfires have already caused significant human health impacts across southeast
Asia, says Funk.

Forest fires directly kill plants and animals, also causing a loss of habitat.

But the biggest problem is that the scale of these fires has increased to the
degree that they themselves have become significant contributors of greenhouse
gas emissions.

After all, trees absorb and store carbon from the atmosphere - so the more trees
that burn down, the harder it is to combat climate change in the future. And
this is dangerous, Funk said.

"It creates a feedback loop: the fires create more emissions, which in turn
contribute to more global warming, which will then cause more fires," Funk said.

"Fires are not the enemy - they are an effect of an underlying process, so we
need to address the problem rather than the symptoms of that problem."

What areas are most affected by wildfire?

According to US federal research, humid, forested areas are most likely to face
greater threats from wildfires, as conditions there grow drier and hotter due to
global warming.

Forests increasingly affected by fire and climate change, and which are thus the
most vulnerable, are in the boreal region. This stretches across the northern
hemisphere through Alaska, Canada, Scandinavia and Russia.

Boreal forest comprises almost a third of forested land in the world, and plays
an important role in absorbing and storing carbon dioxide.

Studies show that especially the Russian and Canadian boreal forests are
increasingly threatened by wildfire, as temperatures are rising faster in these
northern regions than in other areas of the planet.

Funk warns that since rising temperatures are transforming many landscapes,
"we're likely to see more wildfires in more places than just the boreal forest
in the future."

LENGTH: 682  words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: National Fire Protection Association has issued the following news
release:



 The Wildfire Mitigation Awards Committee has announced the 2016 Wildfire
Mitigation Award winners. Established in 2014, the awards are the highest
commendation for the innovation and leadership displayed by individuals and
organizations committed to wildfire preparedness.





 The Wildfire Mitigation Awards are jointly sponsored by the National
Association of State Foresters (NASF), the International Association of Fire
Chiefs (IAFC), the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and the USDA
Forest Service (USFS). The three categories for the awards are Fire Adapted
Communities Fire Service Leadership, Wildfire Mitigation Innovation and the
Community Wildfire Preparedness Pioneer.



 Recognizing the comprehensive challenge posed by wildfires, these awards
commend the outstanding dedication to wildfire preparedness and safety across a
broad spectrum of activities and among a variety of individuals and
organizations. By honoring these achievements, the award sponsors also seek to
increase public recognition and emphasize the value of wildfire mitigation
efforts.



 The winners of the 2016 Wildfire Mitigation Awards are:



 Community Wildfire Preparedness Pioneer Awardees:



     Peggy Beach, volunteer for Firewise of Southwest Colorado (Colorado)

     Les Kole, Firewise ambassador (Colorado)

     Rich Martinson & the Conover/Land O'Lakes Community Wildfire Protection
Plan (CWPP) Committee (Wisconsin)



 Fire Adapted Communities Fire Service Leadership Awardees:



     Fire Chief Mark Shadowens, Northstar Fire Department/Northstar Community

 "State Foresters are proud to honor the efforts of citizens working on the
ground to mitigate the threat of wildfire. These outstanding mitigation efforts
help keep America's communities safe. In 2015, more than 10 million acres of
land were burned by wildfire. As more people build homes and recreate in
forested areas, State Foresters partner with agencies, communities, and
homeowners to create fire-adaptive communities that are better able to withstand
this increasing threat," said Paul DeLong, Wisconsin state forester and
president of the National Association of State Foresters.



 "Wildland fire continues to be a major threat to communities and fire
departments across the U.S.," said Chief Rhoda Mae Kerr, IAFC president and
chair of the board. "The IAFC commends the 2016 Wildfire Mitigation Award
winners for everything they have done to mitigate wildland fire in their
communities and inspire others to do the same."



 "NFPA is pleased to recognize the significant impact these individuals and
groups have made in wildfire preparedness and mitigation," says Michele
Steinberg, manager of NFPA's Wildland Fire Operations Division. "Damaging
wildfire seasons remind us to increase awareness of the value of wildfire
mitigation efforts. These awards are a great way to honor the positive work
being done in communities to keep residents safer from fire."



 "The USDA Forest Service promotes individual and community level fire
adaptation, like forming local all-hands coalitions, supporting fire
departments, reducing hazardous fuels, hardening structures, and smart
development, as the best ways to prepare for wildfire. These awards recognize
and encourage that very important wildfire risk reduction work," said Pam
Leschak, USDA Forest Service National WUI/Fire Adapted Communities program
manager.

Nov. 14--The Rocky Mountain Insurance Information Association is honoring
Wildfire Partners, Boulder County's community wildfire mitigation program, for
its efforts to save lives and property.

Wildfire Partners, which has been credited by as many as eight Nederland-area
homeowners with helping them save their homes during June's Cold Springs Fire,
is to be presented with the Insurance Information Association's Alan Miller
Spirit Award on Tuesday.

"The foundation of Wildfire Partners' success is the engagement of community
partners, such as the insurance industry, from the program's inception," Carole
Walker, Rocky Mountain Insurance Information Association's executive director,
said in a news release.

"But, the real success story being told here is homes saved by homeowners
working to reduce their wildfire risk and Wildfire Partners providing them the
tools to do that," Walker said. "Wildfire Partners was developed as a community
mitigation model and we are now seeing other Colorado communities pattern
mitigation programs after Wildfire Partners."

Wildfire Partners, launched in 2014, is a collaboration with more than 35
partner organizations led by Boulder County. Its primary goal is assisting
homeowners in reducing the threat of wildfire to their properties. Eight hundred
homeowners have participated in the program, which provides technical expertise
with on-site property inspections, follow-up visits, a consumer hotline and
financial support.

Wildfire Partners' homeowners spend an average of 60 hours and $2,400 performing
mitigation and receive an average of $700 in financial assistance from the
program, Boulder County and Rocky Mountain Insurance Information Association
officials said.

"With a hotter and drier climate, we expect to see large increases in the size
of future wildfires. Now is the time for everyone to come together and work in
partnership to prepare for this risk," said Jim Webster, Boulder County's
Wildfire Partners program coordinator.

Wildfire Partners is funded by Boulder County, a $1.25 million Federal Emergency
Management Agency grant and a $1.5 million Colorado Department of Natural
Resources grant. For more information on Wildfire Partners visit

Wildfire sparks interest in phone software

Wildfire Assistant, a product designed to help heavy-duty travelers keep their
work lives from flaring out of control, recently began shipping.

Wildfire Assistant, from Lexington, Mass., start-up Wildfire Communications,
Inc., combines hardware and software to help track and sort calls for users. For
example, the product lets a person at a pay phone take incoming calls.

The market may have given Wildfire Assistant a spark because three companies
have purchased units. In addition, eight companies bought pilot capabilities.

Companies that purchased the first Wildfire units include McCaw Cellular
Communications, Inc., which bought a 72-user system; Natural Microsystems, Inc.,
which bought a 24-user system; and Swiss Bank Corp., which bought a 48-user
system.

Cellular opportunities

McCaw also invested $ 5 million in Wildfire and is considering using the
company's technology to enhance its cellular service. The investment is not
exclusive, and Wildfire is talking to other phone companies about ways to build
its services into their systems.

Nicholas D'Arbeloff, Wildfire co-founder and vice president of marketing, said
the McCaw investment "is a huge step" for Wildfire because it may open up new
markets for the Wildfire Assistant. For instance, small companies typically
cannot afford to purchase Wildfire Assistant. However, giving them the option to
buy Wildfire Assistant's capabilities from a phone carrier could tap a
significant market for the company.

D'Arbeloff also said none of Wildfire Assistant's beta sites have dropped the
product, and the company is "very close" to selling systems to several of those
companies.

One beta tester that purchased the pilot software is Temps & Co. in Washington,
a temporary personnel agency.

Jason Feldman, a subcontractor at Temps & Co. who runs its Wildfire project,
said the company is seriously considering applying the product to several
aspects of the business. He said Temps & Co. is examining Wildfire Assistant's
voice recognition.

Feldman said the company believes it can use voice recognition as a competitive
advantage over other temporary agencies, particularly in conjunction with
internal databases. He declined to specify in what ways.

Wildfire is now focusing on building relationships with other carriers and
developing a sales channel, D'Arbeloff said. The company is also plunging ahead
to develop a version of its software that will run over networks.

Previously, Wildfire officials had said the company was focusing on revising the
current software to in-clude specific modules, such as a time-tracking feature
for client-intensive companies that want to track time spent on the phone with
clients for billing purposes.

D'Arbeloff said the time-tracking feature was still in progress but was not as
high a priority as developing a networked version of the product.

Ottawa, Aug 8 (IBNS): The wildfire which was struck in early July scorched more
than five lakh hectares in the British Columbia so far.

In a tweet, BC Wildfire Service stated approximately 591, 280 hectares of land
were scorched till now. The update provided by the BC Wildfire also said around
132 wildfires are still burning. There have been 900 wildfires since April 1, BC
Wildfire said.

Were signing off for the night. If there are significant developments through
the night, we will post updates as they become available.

On July 7, the disaster occurred when lightening storm made the fire spread
rapidly in the Interior of B.C. An emergency was called immediately after the
wildfire. It continued to grow forcing local people to flee from their homes. A
media report on July 28 suggested around 10000 people were forced to go out of
Williams Lake, the largest city in the Central Interior of British Columbia,
which was under a high alert. This years wildfire has now become the worst since
1958, Global News said. The record of wildfires are kept since 1950. In 1958,
8560 sq. kms were burnt due to the wildfire contrary to 4910 in 2017, the latter
recording much lesser than the former. Still, 2017 wildfire is considered to be
dreadful as statistically it is the worst in last 59 years. Meanwhile, the
ongoing provincial state of emergency has been extended till August 18. New
Zealand firefighters have extended their helping hands to Canada with an aim to
combat the ongoing wildfire in British Columbia. New Zealand firefighters
support came at a time when around 4000 Canadian firefighters are working to get
the situation under control. On August 3, Fire and Emergency New Zealand took to
Twitter to announce their plan of combating the wildfire. New Zealand

Progress in detection, not in response

LENGTH: 1409 words

DATELINE: KATHMANDU


KATHMANDU, April 9 -- In April 2009, a fire that tore through a community forest
of Ramechhap district claimed the lives of as many as 13 Nepal Army (NA)
soldiers. They had been mobilized to contain the fire after it began spreading
toward the Ramechhap District Hospital. As soon as the soldiers entered into the
forest, the wind started blowing in the opposite direction, leaving no room for
them to flee anywhere. The charred remains of all the soldiers were found later.

In Nepal, this is the most shocking tragedy caused by wildfires in the last five
years. Since 2009, there have not been so many deaths in a single wildfire
incident. However, wildfires continue to claim human lives every year. This year
alone, as many as seven people have already been killed by wildfires as of now.
And, these are just reported deaths. More people might have been killed or
injured by wildfires in far-flung forest areas.

Loss of human lives is just one dimension of damage caused by wildfires. Apart
from human deaths, wild animals, biodiversity, medicinal herbs and forestry
products worth millions of rupees also face threats from wildfires in Nepal
every year.

community forest is seen spreading almost to Tansen bazaar of Palpa. (Tek

"By a conservative estimate, forestry products worth about Rs 440 million were
reduced to ashes in 2012," says Sundar Sharma, coordinator of Regional South
Asia Wildland Fire Network, which is a component of the UN-ISDR (International
Strategy for Disaster Reduction). "If wildfires cause such a huge financial
damage in just one year, how much money will we lose in ten years?"

Between 2009 and 2012, altogether 63 people have been killed and 58 injured by
wildfires, according to the UN-ISDR's South Asia network. In this same period,
590 houses and 49 sheds have been gutted by wildfires. "Due to lack of immediate
interventions, wildfires at times spread to nearby human settlements and damage
private properties, too," explains Sharma.

In a move to control wildfires, the International Center for Integrated Mountain
Development (ICIMOD) has developed a system to detect active forest fires.
Through satellites, a station set up by the ICIMOD in Kathmandu not only traces
active wildfires but also posts detailed information about them on its website.
At the same time, it automatically sends fire alerts through emails and SMSes to
forest authorities and key members of Community Forest User Groups (CFUGs). "We
are trying to send active fire alerts to a wider group of stakeholders," says
Pashupati Koirala, an officer at the Department of Forest (DoF).

However, despite making a remarkable progress in detection of active fires,
controlling wildfires is still proving to be an uphill task in Nepal. Lack of
human resources, skills and equipments combined with geographical difficulty
have made it almost impossible for forest authorities as well as CFUG members to
effectively deal with wildfires.

"We get regular fire alerts," says Apsara Chapagain, president of Federation of
Community Forest Users' Group Nepal (FECOFUN). "But these alerts are virtually
useless. What is the use of such alerts if you can do nothing to control
wildfires? At times, forest fire rages in front of our own eyes but we feel
helpless."

According to Chapagain, members of some 15 CFUGs were trained to fight forest
fires under a project two years ago. "They were also provided with forest
fighting tools," says she. "The trained and well-equipped CFUG members are
pretty good at fighting wildfires. But how can we expect to fight wildfires
across the country by handing equipments to such a few people?"

Just last year, the Japan government provided 53 vehicles and 120 sets of fire
fighting tools to the Nepal government. However, the District Forest Offices
(DFOs) lack manpower to use those tools. About 500 of the total 1,086 posts of
armed forest guards and over 700 of the total 2,756 posts of unarmed forest
guards have been lying vacant for a long time. "In forestry sector, we just have
hakims (bosses) but not those staff who are ready to work on the field," says a
forest official. "In such condition, it is possible that fire fighting
equipments will be lying unused."

Community's role is important

Community's role is important

How serious is the threat of wildfire in Nepal?

It is a big threat. It is a threat to human lives and properties, wild animals,
biodiversity, forestry products including medicinal herbs. At times, wildfires
spread to human settlements and reduce properties to ashes. Even people get
killed in wildfires. This year alone, as many as seven people have died in
wildfires. Forestry products worth millions of rupees are gutted by wildfires
every year. Its damage is beyond measurement.

Some people, including forestry experts, argue that wildfires are part of a
natural process and good for growth of forests. Do you agree?

Yes, I do. But it is good only if wildfires are managed with prescription. I
mean we need controlled burning to reduce the forest fuel. Wildfires always burn
down old, drying and decaying plants, bushes, leaves and twigs, creating space
for new plants to germinate and grow. Remains of the burnt plants are like
fertilizers and make the soil more fertile. However, wildfires are not properly
managed in Nepal. In dry season, you can see wildfires everywhere, even in
national parks inhabited by endangered species such as tigers and rhinos. If a
rhino is killed by wildfires, how much loss will we incur?

How serious are forest authorities about wildfire management?

Not really. The Forest Ministry lacks dedicated institution and human resources
capable of dealing with wildfires. It is not able to even retain a few available
experts. In 2010, the government came up with a national strategy for forest
fire management. In its strategy, the government has stated that it will develop
an institution to tackle the epidemic of wildfires. But no progress has been
made so far in that direction. There is no specific section or authority at the
Forest Ministry for forest fire management. Why does the Forest Ministry not set
up a unit for fighting forest fires? Forest fires can be both cause and effect
of climate change. So, if we develop a strong institution within the Forest
Ministry to manage wildfires, it will not be difficult for us to find financial
support from international donor agencies working in the sector of climate
change.

How capable are the District Forest Offices (DFOs) in dealing with wildfires?

Individually, we have capable forest officials who have the willingness to do
something. But our institutions are weak. They are constrained by the lack of
financial and technical resources. They do not have adequate and appropriate
firefighting tools and skilled human resources to manage forest fires. In such a
situation all they can do is pray for Indra (the rain god). Quite often,
wildfires continue to spread unless they are extinguished by rains. They are
helpless.

So, in present situation, what could be the best way to combat wildfires?

Community-based forest fire management (CBFIM) could be the best option.
Firstly, we have nearly 18,000 Community Forest Users' Groups (CFUGs) in Nepal.
Similarly, there are several other community-based cultural groups. They can be
mobilized for forest fire management. But they cannot always work voluntarily.
If they are to be mobilized in a sustainable way, there must be a livelihood
option for them. Secondly, for this, the government has to develop a multi-year
fire management program for a long run. As part of my research, I had
implemented this concept in Sundar Community Forest of Makwanpur district with
support from the German Foreign Office and the Global Fire Monitoring Center
(GFMC). I am proud to say that the government has incorporated this concept into
the policy and the government and its development partners have also
incorporated the learning of community-based forest fire management program of
Makawnpur in programs like Tarai Arch Landscape (TAL) project and
Multistakeholder Forestry Programme (MSFP) in their project areas and beyond.

Wildfire sparks interest;
Personal assistant uses voice recognition.

BYLINE: Ellen Messmer

SECTION: TOP NEWS; Pg. 1

Lexington, Mass.

All right you Star Trek fans, haven't you ever secretly wished for an electronic
aide who responds to voice commands like the computer aboard the Enterprise?

If so, you may be in the market for Wildfire Assistant, a computer-based
telephony application that follows your orders through speech recognition to
handle the daily barrage of phone calls whether you are in the office or on the
road.

Developed by start-up Wildfire Communications, Inc., the product can place phone
calls on your behalf, announce incoming calls and, knowing your routine,
automatically forward calls to your phone or pager wherever you are.

Wildfire Assistant which has a kind of no-nonsense, woman-of-the-90s voice will
remind you when you are scheduled to make a call and place it for you. You do
not carry it around with you Wildfire Assistant is available to you by picking
up your phone at your desk or calling in to your Wildfire number.

"It's a dedicated personal assistant that's as close as the nearest phone," said
William Warner, Wildfire's chief executive officer.

Out of sight to the user, the Wildfire Assistant is an object-oriented
application on a Pentium-based Unix computer with integrated telephone line and
speech-recognition cards.

This Wildfire server, which includes an internal switch for routing calls,
processes spoken commands to initiate or redirect calls by accessing a directory
of names and telephone numbers users have established. It can also route calls
by following a set schedule.

According to industry analyst Andrew Seybold, who publishes the "Outlook on
Mobile Computing," the Wildfire Assistant is the first of its class and a boon
to professionals on the go. "There is nothing like it that is comparable,"
Seybold said. "I've been impressed."

So are beta users of the product, which is set to ship in January.

Boston-based law firm Hale & Dorr has used Wildfire since spring. Attorneys
there like the fact that Wildfire lets them have a single number they can give
out to clients to ensure calls follow them wherever they go. That includes
forwarding calls to cellular phones.

"Clients want to reach you when they want you," said senior partner Hal
Leibowitz. "You don't have to give them three different numbers to find you."

Wildfire is flexible in carrying out assignments. If a user wants to be
interrupted during one call to take an important incoming call, the Wildfire
Assistant inaudible to the other parties whispers the name of the second caller.
The Wildfire user can either take the call or ignore it, in which case it will
be sent to Wildfire's voice mail for retrieval later.

"You can give it a schedule and it follows you along," Leibowitz said. "It's
amazing. If only it had a time module for billing clients."

Investment firm First Albany Corp. in New York beta-tested Wildfire for nearly
three months.

"I'm a thorough fan of the whole thing," said Barry McCurdy, First Albany's
director of research. "It's extremely productive and helpful. It gives me names
and numbers of people wherever I am. I listen to the ones I want to hear
immediately, and the rest are stored."

At prices ranging from $ 47,000 to $ 97,000 for up to 72 users, Wildfire is
pricey. "It's not cheap," McCurdy agreed. "But it's not just voice mail; it's a
mobile voice assistant."

Nick d'Arbeloff, Wildfire's vice president of marketing, said Wildfire lets
users open up what the company calls a Virtual Hallway by simply asking the
system, "Who else is around?" After Wildfire relates who is currently using the
system, the caller can choose to speak with an individual down the "hall."

Future product plans include versions of Wildfire that will work with fax,
private branch exchanges, LANs and wireless communications.

Washington: Wyden, Crapo, Bennet, Tester, Risch Introduce Bill to Improve Fire
Recovery and Mitigation Efforts

LENGTH: 851  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Ron Wyden has issued the following news
release:

U.S. Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jon
Tester (D-MT) and Jim Risch (R-ID) introduced the Wildfire Mitigation Assistance
Act to provide resources to assist communities recovering from damaging
wildfires. The bill treats wildfires in the same manner as other natural
disasters by making available Hazard Mitigation Assistance funding to states
affected by catastrophic wildfires.


"Wildfires have unfortunately proven once again to be the West's natural
disasters," Wyden said. "This is urgent business that requires an equally urgent
and comprehensive response. This bill marks a key piece of that response to help
people recover from the devastation of wildfires by providing funding to local
governments to reduce flooding and erosion after fires, monitor stream and
habitat health and assist residents in clearing brush from around their homes
and businesses."
"Wildfires have catastrophic effects across the West," Bennet said. "We can
dramatically reduce the severity and damage from these wildfires through
mitigation work that minimizes the risk of flooding, erosion, and future fires.
This bill would make it easier for affected communities to receive federal
resources for post-fire recovery and mitigation efforts."
"Throughout the American west, we have felt firsthand the devastation wildfires
have on our habitat, our health and our way of life," Crapo said.  "The Wildfire
Mitigation Assistance Act would allow fire-prone communities to apply for Hazard
Mitigation grants through the Federal Emergency Management Agency in order to
undertake 'fire-wise' projects for homes in the wildland urban interface or to
reduce hazardous fuels.  Congress must continue to pursue efforts aimed at
reducing the risk and severity of wildfires, as well as improve the response,
prevention and mitigation efforts."
"I have seen firsthand the impact that catastrophic wildfires have on our
communities," Tester said. "Folks impacted by wildfire need assistance long
after the flames stop burning, and this bill will help ensure that folks on the
ground can restore land impacted by fire and better prevent future disasters."

"Massive wildfires destroy homes, businesses, and ecosystems in the west just
like catastrophic hurricanes destroy communities in coastal regions," said
Risch. "This bill will help local governments in Idaho and across the west deal
with the aftermath of large wildfires."
Background on the Wildfire Mitigation Assistance Act:
Currently, states can receive hazard mitigation funding to lessen the effects of
a future disaster only after the president declares a major disaster. However,
unlike in the case of hurricanes, floods, or tornados, most wildfires do not
receive a major disaster declaration. This bill will allow states affected by
wildfires to access the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) to implement
measures that reduce the risk of flooding and erosion and take actions to
prevent future wildfires.
Bennet first introduced this measure as part of the PREPARE Act in 2015. Last
week, Bennet, Crapo, Wyden, and Risch attended a briefing with U.S. Agriculture
Secretary Sonny Perdue to press the issue. Last month, Bennet introduced the
Wildfire Disaster Act of 2017 and sent a bipartisan letter urging Senate Leaders
McConnell (R-KY) and Charles Schumer (D-NY) to include a wildfire funding fix in
any future disaster aid legislation.
Statements of support for the legislation:
"Wildfires continue to wreak tremendous damage across our Western landscapes and
communities," said Roy Charles Brooks, President of National Association of
Counties. "They threaten public safety, pollute the air, foul our waters and
disrupt economic and recreational activity. The Wildfire Mitigation Assistance
Act would help focus resources - federal, state and local - to prevent and
recover from wildfires. Counties thank Senators Bennet, Crapo, Risch, Tester and
Wyden for their leadership on this crucial issue."
"I thank Senator Bennet for introducing this important legislation," said Fire
Chief Thomas Jenkins, President and Chairman of the Board of International
Association of Fire Chiefs. "Flooding and landslides can be a serious threat to
communities already suffering from major wildland fire damage. This bill will
help communities prevent further damage from these natural disasters. The IAFC
supports this legislation and urges Congress to pass it."
"While we are frequently judged based on response and criticized based on
recovery, mitigation and preparedness are critical phases of emergency
management and they most often occur outside the spotlight," said Robie
Robinson, former President of the U.S. Council of the International Association
of Emergency Managers. "As mitigation is the linchpin of emergency management,
expanding hazard mitigation grant funding following a Fire Management Assistance
Grant declaration will enable jurisdictions to implement programs that will
effectively reduce risks and return benefits many fold."

Guest column: Long way from knowing causes

BYLINE: John R. Snyder, Ph.D., Writer

LENGTH: 648 words

DATELINE: Idaho Falls, ID


Wildfires have been attributed more and more to climate change, but it's really
not that simple, writes John R. Snyder, Ph.D.

Last year's media frenzy over climate change and California wildfires shows why
our schools need to teach critical thinking skills and to question conventional
wisdom, whether it's science-based or not.

An earlier Commentary letter claimed that CO2 emissions from burning fossil
fuels causes global warming, which then caused the widespread and destructive
California wildfires in 2017. However, it's not that simple.

While atmospheric warming may contribute to localized drought, and drought is a
factor in the number of wildfires and the acres burned, it is important to
remember that drought is only one factor; there are many other causes of
wildfires, both natural and man made.

But let's examine the relationship between atmospheric CO2 concentrations and
the 2017 California wildfires. CO2 concentrations prior to 1958 were less than
320 parts permillion. Since 1958, CO2 concentrations have increased consistently
and dramatically to over 400 ppmtoday.

If we accept that atmospheric CO2 concentration is the cause - or even a major
cause - of the number and destruction of wildfires, then historical records for
CO2 and wildfires should be directly proportional. That means the number and
destructiveness of wildfires should have steadily increased since 1958.

Instead we find that the number of wildfires in California has steadily
"decreased" for nearly 40years; from 9,009 in 1980 to a low of 2,434 in 2010
(CAL FIRE statistics). In contrast, preliminary reports for 2017 are 7,117
wildfires. The decrease in wildfire numbers were described in the International
Journal of Wildland Fire (April 2017): "Different historical fire-climate
patterns in California."

While the number of wildfires has steadily decreased, the acres burned has shown
a positive trend. However, an author expresses caution in ascribing the increase
to global warming: "People who have written on it tend to ascribe it to climate
change, but I think we are a long way from knowing if that is what is going on."

According to the author, "One reason acreage [burned] may be up is from the
record winter rains that replenished fuel by spawning plant growth, including
the return of grass that has disappeared from wildland areas throughout Southern
California during the drought."

Any hypothesis that CO2 causes an increase in wildfire numbers and destruction
must explain the 40-year trend of declining California wildfire numbers despite
increasing CO2 concentrations.

So why have the number of California wildfires decreased since 1980? According
to one study, "there is now a forest "fire deficit" in the western United
States..." attributable to human activities (e.g., fire suppression, grazing),
ecological and climate changes. The study was summarized by WildfireToday, which
concluded "We owe the ecosystem some fire, and the debt collector has come to
visit." Records for the last 1,500 years suggest that the number of western
wildfires should be increasing, not decreasing as they have in California since
1980; therefore, a fire deficit. The 2017 California wildfire impact was similar
to the peaks observed in the geological record and in the 1800's.

A Google search on "cause of western wildfires" brings up several links relevant
to this discussion. One is on the Mother Jones website which reinforces the
human-caused climate change argument. Another is FactCheck.org., which says,
"The answer is: It's complicated."

In future columns, we'll examine the danger of the Mother
Joneshttps://www.motherjones.com/environment/2017/10/heres-why-wildfires

Stop Wildfires at the Starting Line: Tori Bowie, Olympic Gold Medalist, World's
Fastest Woman, Featured in Wildfire Prevention PSA

BYLINE: Mississippi Forestry Commission

LENGTH: 556  words


Jackson, MS,  February 18, 2018 --(PR.com)-- Help the Mississippi Forestry
Commission Stop Wildfires at the Starting Line.

Mississippian Tori Bowie, World's Fastest Woman, featured in Wildfire Prevention
PSA.

World's Fastest Woman (2017 IAAF World Champion), Olympic Gold Medalist, and
Mississippi native Tori Bowie is featured in the Mississippi Forestry
Commission's (MFC) new public service announcement video, Stop Wildfires at the
Starting Line, designed to heighten public awareness of wildfire prevention.
Produced by the Jackson-based video production and advertising firm Mad Genius,
the series received grant funding made available by the U.S. Forest Service.
Bowie is featured in the thirty-second video, which intends to remind the public
of the destructive power of wildfires and how quickly they can spread.

Bowie is a native of Sand Hill, Mississippi; she attended Pisgah High School and
the University of Southern Mississippi. Bowie competed in the 2016 Rio de
Janeiro Olympic Games, where she won her first gold medal. The following year,
Bowie would go on to win two more gold medals in London at the 2017 IAAF World
Championships.

Wildfires in Mississippi are often human-caused

A small spark can start a large wildfire when conditions are dry and windy. The
wind carries embers long distances, which can cause spot fires as far away as
one-half mile from the burning area. Wildfires are known to move at speeds of up
to 14 mph, which means they have the ability to spread quickly, potentially
overtaking anything in their path - endangering life, property, and forestland.

"Nationwide, nearly 9 out of 10 wildfires are human-caused, which means 9 out of
10 wildfires could have been prevented with proper care," said Charlie Morgan,
State Forester, Mississippi Forestry Commission. "Sadly, debris burns that
escaped control were the number one cause of wildfires in Mississippi last
year."

The best way to prevent devastating wildfire occurrences is never to let one
start. Help the MFC Stop Wildfires at the Starting Line. To learn more about how

EDITORIAL: Be ready and set, and go when a wildfire is near

BYLINE: Appeal-Democrat, Marysville, Calif.

SECTION: COMMENTARY

LENGTH: 481 words


May 06--There was just enough moisture over the winter and spring months here to
green up the prairies and hills around here ... for just a little while. All
that new growth? It's drying out fast. It will be tinder dry before very long.

That complicates things. So do fire-fighting budgets, and so does water
availability due to drought conditions. So we're pushing along the "Wildfire
Awareness Week" (May 3 to 9) agenda: Be prepared for the worst.

Drought conditions significantly elevate our fire danger. And during this
awareness week, CalFire is trying to remind everyone of the role they play in
preparing for and preventing wildfires.

"With a record dry and warm winter, Californian's fire activity has been nearly
double what it normally is for this time of year," said Chief Ken Pimlott,
CalFire director, in a news release.

"Our firefighters continue to meet the challenges posed by California's historic
drought, but we all must do our part to ensure our homes are prepared for
wildfire and that residents and visitors to our state take extreme caution to
avoid sparking a wildfire."

On May 1, the Department of Water Resources announced that California's snowpack
water content was only 3 percent of normal, according to the news release. The
lack of snow and overall rainfall has led to conditions being much drier than
normal, lending themselves to the quick spread of wildfire.

Between Jan. 1 and May 2, CalFire has responded to over 1,100 wildfires that
have charred over 4,200 acres. In an average year for the same time period,
CalFire would typically respond to fewer than 650 wildfires burning
approximately 1,500 acres.

The department encourages us, when it comes to wildfires, to remember "Ready,
Set, Go!"

--Being ready for a wildfire starts by maintaining 100 feet of defensible space
and hardening homes with fire resistant building materials. During this drought,
CalFire is highly recommending residents landscape their yards with
drought-tolerant and fire- resistant plants.

--Being set includes have an evacuation plan and an emergency supply kit.

--Lastly, when a wildfire strikes, residents are urged to go. Evacuate early,
it's urged.

CalFire is also urging all Californians to learn the steps to prevent sparking a
wildfire. Over 90 percent of the wildfires in the state are sparked by the
activity of people, thus the "One Less Spark, One Less Wildfire" campaign.

Residents looking for additional information on how to prepare themselves, their
families and their homes for wildfire can visit www.ReadyForWildfire.org. The
site offers tips for residents to make their homes more resistant to wildfires
and to ensure that their families are ready to evacuate early and safely when a
wildfire strikes.

DLNR & HWMO NEWS RELEASE: Two dozen state, county and federal agencies launch
2017 wildfire awareness campaign with a May 6 contest; #wildfirereadyHI

LENGTH: 646  words




Honolulu: David Y. lge Governor of the State of Hawaii, The State of Hawaii has
issued the following news release:
 Government and non-government organizations from across the state today,
announced a contest that will launch the collaborative 2017 Wildfire Lookout!
campaign to raise awareness about the threat of wildfire to Hawaii's natural
resources and to private and public property.  It is the season when wildfires
begin ramping up across the country, and Hawaii is no exception. The Wildfire
Lookout! contest invites people to take steps to protect Hawaii's homes,
families, and natural resources from the threat of wildfire by taking
preventative action on May 6, 2017 and throughout the month of May.  May 6 is
Community Wildfire Preparedness Day across Hawaii and the US.


The Wildfire Lookout! contest encourages residents in Hawaii to take action in
one of the following categories:
1) Clean up your yard or practice a family emergency plan;
2) Participate in a local event organized as part of the Wildfire Lookout!
effort;
3) Work with your neighbors to do a community wildfire hazard reduction project.

Anyone who takes actions toward wildfire preparedness in Hawaii is invited to
submit stories and photos via Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using the hashtag
#WildfireReadyHI or email them to admin@hawaiiwildfire.org as part of the
statewide contest.  Local businesses are sponsoring the Wildfire Lookout!
campaign by providing prizes to contest winners.  Prizes will be awarded in each
of the above categories.
Detailed information regarding practices for fire-safe landscaping and home
maintenance are available as part of the Wildfire Lookout! campaign.  A current
list of local events and opportunities to join is also available.  Both can be
found at hawaiiwildfire.org.
The Department of Land and Natural Resources ' Division of Forestry and Wildlife
(DOFAW) is the lead agency charged with wildfire prevention and suppression on
public lands across the state.  DLNR Chair Suzanne Case said, "We hope this
campaign and contest will educate and inform everyone living in and visiting
Hawaii about the threat of wildfires. While fires here in Hawaii burn smaller
acreages than in much larger western states, the percentage of forest land we
lose each year to wildfire, based on Hawaii's actual land mass, is equal to
states like California."
"Proactive, preventative action is safer and far more effective than doing
nothing and relying on suppression, or even worse, trying to recover from the
broader, less publicized impacts of wildfire.  Many people are surprised to
learn about the long-lasting and serious impacts fire has on Hawaii's coral
reefs, water quality, municipal infrastructure, and more," says Elizabeth
Pickett, Executive Director of Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization. "It all
starts with personal action, and when everyone does their part, that adds up to
a safer and healthier Hawaii."
This is exactly the type of activity we hope to encourage during the "Wildfire
Lookout!" campaign and May contest.  Wildfire Lookout!, is a continuing effort
to keep people across the state informed of current fire and drought conditions
and provide tips on protecting homes and families from wildfire.
University of Hawaii, Cooperative Extension Wildland Fire Specialist, Dr. Clay
Trauernicht adds, "It is a win-win for everyone to take part in hazard reduction
activities. Entering the Wildfire Lookout! contest provides a fun and worthwhile
incentive to get started on activities we've all been meaning to do anyway
around our homes and communities. These types of preventative actions are
actually quite simple to implement, and make a huge difference in the health and
safety of our families, lands, and waters."

THE Western Wildires senior men's cricket side's Neville Castle and Mark
McKinnon have gained selection in the NSW team to take on Queensland in a State
of Origin fixture to be held in Coffs Harbour this month.

Both players deserve their selection and it is hoped they perform strongly in
what is always a keenly contested match.

In the Wildfires latest match, they took on the strong Quirindi team in Mudgee.

Wildfires' captain Grahame Danaher won the toss and elected to bat and it looked
a good decision with the Wildfires taking 30 runs off the first three overs.

Opener Neil Hutchinson was brilliantly caught on the boundary in the fourth over
and the Wildfires never recovered, struggling to reach 145 off 39 overs.

Ross Baker (33 not out) and Barry Fitzgerald (19) featured in a 10th wicket
stand of 47 which added some respectability to a disappointing scorecard.

Graeme Glazebrook (28) and Grahame Danaher (27) showed some good form but full
credit had to go to the Quirindi bowlers who bowled accurately in the hot
conditions.

In reply Quirindi passed the Wildfires total with just three wickets down.

Barry Fitzgerald capped off a good match with a well-deserved wicket while Neil
Hutchinson and Gil McGrath were the other successful bowlers.

The next Wildfires match will see the Central Coast team come to Lithgow for a
return match on March 13.

This will take place at Watsford Oval with the Wildfires keen to avenge their
narrow loss the last time the two teams met.

The final matches for the Wildfires this season will be in Echuca where they
will participate in a five day carnival.

The carnival will feature teams from Tasmania, ACT, Victoria and South
Australia.

Anyone interested in joining the Wildfires is reminded that training is held on
Wednesday at the Watsford Oval nets at 8.15am.

New players will be made most welcome with the emphasis being on giving every
player an opportunity in a casual social environment.

The Wildfires also thank sponsors Macquarie Stem Cell

Research, Centennial Coal and Lithgow Hotel.

Without the support of these organisations the Wildfires would not be able to
function and provide local cricketers with an opportunity to actively
participate in seniors competitions.

Wildfires' wrap-up

The Wildfires have met with mixed success in a series of matches staged over the
past month or so which has seen them oppose some of the strongest regional sides
in NSW seniors cricket.

The first series of matches was played in Mudgee over the Australia Day period
with three regional sides from Tamworth, Lower North Coast and Lithgow playing
matches over successive days.

The weekend was a great success and was staged in Mudgee in an effort to promote
seniors cricket in the area and hopefully to see Mudgee participate in future
events.

On day one the Wildfires were opposed to the strong Tamworth side who fielded a
number of NSW representative players.

Tamworth won the toss and batted first on a Victoria Park wicket that looked
likely to favour the batsmen.

At the end of their 40 overs Tamworth amassed 181 runs with the Wildfires
dropping several catches and, coupled with some poor ground fielding, allowing
Tamworth some easy runs in the last 10 overs.

In response the Wildfires finished on 9-162 after their allotted overs with
Neville Castle contributing a classy 45 not out.

Other batsmen to show some form were Tony Burrows in his Wildfires debut and
John Haddin who was working the ball around nicely until succumbing to a leg
injury.

Castle was the deserved winner of the Wildfires man of the match award.

On day two the Wildfires opposed the Lower North Coast team who they had played
previously in the NSW championships and came away with a five wicket victory.

The Coast boys struggled against a Wildfires bowling attack boosted by the
return of Mark McKinnon, and with some improved ground fielding and catching the
visitors were dismissed for just 86.

Steven Walsh, Ross Baker and Gil McGrath all bowled well with David Hicks
beating the bat on a number of occasions without taking a wicket.

In reply the Wildfires passed the visitors total with five wickets down, Castle
and Steven Walsh guiding the team to victory with 12 overs to spare.

Wildfires man of the match was Steven Walsh who captured three wickets and made
19 runs in the victory.

On Australia Day five Wildfires players ' Neville Castle, David Hicks, Graeme
Glazebrook, Mark McKinnon and Steven Walsh ' played in the representative
fixture against Mudgee.

Mark McKinnon again bowled accurately finishing with 0-11 off his six overs
while Hicks, Walsh and Castle all captured a wicket.

Mudgee were dismissed in their last over for 156 which proved to be 20 runs
short of a competitive target.

In reply the representative team passed the Mudgee total with five wickets in
hand.

Graeme Glazebrook was the top scorer with a hard hitting 30 while both Walsh and
Castle contributed double figure scores.

The match was played in great spirit with a great deal of interest generated
among the Mudgee cricket ranks.

The Wildfires next match was against the Central Coast side at Taylor Park, The
Entrance.

This match saw the Wildfires go down by just three runs, failing to chase down
the home side's modest total of 114 off their 40 overs.

A low, slow pitch and lush outfield made scoring difficult with a couple of late
run outs costing the Wildfires dearly.

David Hicks bowled well capturing two wickets while Neville Castle once again
led the way with the bat with a well compiled 45 runs.

Tony Luchetti Sportsground was the venue for the Wildfires next match against
the Southern Highlands.

The Wildfires were keen to avenge a narrow loss to the Southern Highlands side
earlier in the season but unfortunately some poor bowling and fielding lapses
saw the visitors emerge victorious by 41 runs.

Laurie Northey was the pick of the Wildfires bowlers capably supported by Neil
Hutchinson who worked hard with the ball.

The last 10 overs from the Wildfires were expensive with the visitors scoring
freely to reach 182 at the end of their 40 overs.

In reply the Wildfires were all out for 141 with Bruce Pearce finding some form
with a classy 43 not out.

Others to show some form were Neville Castle, Steven Walsh and Laurie Northey
but unfortunately wickets fell regularly with the Wildfires unable to mount some
pressure on the visitors bowling Castle and McKinnon named in NSW side.

Idaho: Crapo, Risch, Western Senators Introduce Bill to Improve Fire Recovery
and Mitigation Efforts

LENGTH: 551  words



Boise: The Senate Office of United States Senate, Idaho has issued the following
news release:
U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jon Tester (D-MT), Jim
Risch (R-ID), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) introduced the Wildfire Mitigation Assistance
Act to provide resources to assist communities recovering from damaging
wildfires. The bill treats wildfires in the same manner as other natural
disasters by making available Hazard Mitigation Assistance funding to states
affected by catastrophic wildfires.


The measure would provide states affected by wildfires access to the Hazard
Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) through the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).  HMGP funds would allow states to implement tactics that diminish
damages caused by wildfires, and also to carry out plans to prevent future
wildfires.  Different from last week's announcement that the Office of
Management recommended funding to replace the more than $570 million transferred
away in this year's fire season from forest restoration accounts to fight a
record fire season, the Wildfire Mitigation Assistance Act would direct FEMA
funding to wildfire prevention activities.
"Throughout the American west, we have felt firsthand the devastation wildfires
have on our habitat, our health and our way of life," Crapo said.  "The Wildfire
Mitigation Assistance Act would allow fire-prone communities to apply for Hazard
Mitigation grants through the Federal Emergency Management Agency in order to
undertake 'fire-wise' projects for homes in the wildland urban interface or to
reduce hazardous fuels.  Congress must continue to pursue efforts aimed at
reducing the risk and severity of wildfires, as well as improve the response,
prevention and mitigation efforts."
"Wildfires have catastrophic effects across the West," Bennet said. "We can
dramatically reduce the severity and damage from these wildfires through
mitigation work that minimizes the risk of flooding, erosion, and future fires.
This bill would make it easier for affected communities to receive federal
resources for post-fire recovery and mitigation efforts."
"Massive wildfires destroy homes, businesses, and ecosystems in the west just
like catastrophic hurricanes destroy communities in coastal regions," said
Risch. "This bill will help local governments in Idaho and across the west deal
with the aftermath of large wildfires."
"I have seen firsthand the impact that catastrophic wildfires have on our
communities," Tester said. "Folks impacted by wildfire need assistance long
after the flames stop burning, and this bill will help ensure that folks on the
ground can restore land impacted by fire and better prevent future disasters."

"Wildfires have unfortunately proven once again to be the West's natural
disasters," Wyden said. "This is urgent business that requires an equally urgent
and comprehensive response. This bill marks a key piece of that response to help
people recover from the devastation of wildfires by providing funding to local
governments to reduce flooding and erosion after fires, monitor stream and
habitat health and assist residents in clearing brush from around their homes
and businesses."

Texas Wildfire Prevention Task Force created

BYLINE: The Lakelander staff

LENGTH: 578  words


AUSTIN - As Texas continues to recover from the losses of last year's historic
wildfire season, Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples today announced the
establishment of the Texas Wildfire Prevention Task Force to maximize wildfire
prevention and mitigation strategies across the state.

"With a state as vast in size and as diverse in environment as Texas, we must be
strategic in our wildfire prevention and mitigation efforts," Commissioner
Staples said.

Last year the Texas Forest Service and local fire departments responded to more
than 30,000 individual fires burning nearly 4 million acres in Texas. Priorities
of the Texas Wildfire Prevention Task Force will include reducing the cause of
wildfires by strategically identifying and targeting priority areas of the state
for fuels reduction. In partnership with the Texas Division of Emergency
Management, the Texas Forest Service and the Texas State Soil and Water
Conservation Board, the task force will facilitate communication with local
leaders and landowners to identify high risk areas where fire prevention
resources are most needed.

"This task force will take on the important work of helping communities use
preventative measures, like increasing prescribed burns, to prevent wildfires
before they even start," said Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim
Kidd.

"I've said it before, 'If all hell's going to break loose -1 want to be in
Texas!' Why? Because the fire service in this state stands together and we work
hard on interagency coordination," said Texas Forest Service Director Tom
Boggus. "All branches of Texas fire service - paid and volunteer -work to make
Texas a national model and leader for wildfire prevention and mitigation."

Commissioner Staples has worked with the Legislature to identify and implement
tools to limit the spread of wildfires, including several enhancements to the
state's certification program for trained and insured prescribed bum managers,
which resides at the Texas Department of Agriculture. New licensing categories
have been created, which have facilitated a 100-percent increase in the number
of qualified, licensed and insured prescrihed burn managers in Texas. This
action will in turn increase the use of prescribed bums to help reduce the
threat of wildfires. In Texas, certified prescribed bum managers utilize
controlled and intentional fire as a tool to reduce grasses, brush and natural
overgrowth that often fuel uncontrolled wildfires.

"Controlled fire is the best tool to prevent wildfires," Commissioner Staples
said. "Trying to control a wildfire is much more costly and difficult than
eliminating the fuel for that wildfire before it starts. The updates in our
prescribed burning procedures and the new Texas Wildfire Prevention Task Force
will help reduce the risk of potential wildfires, which risk the lives of our
citizens and damage communities, crops, livestock and wildlife."

The task force will complement new web applications created by the Texas Forest

Service and the Texas A&M University System that will help homeowners and
communities determine wildfire risk and take measures to mitigate potential
hazards. The Texas Wildfire Risk Assessment Portal, or TxWRAE allows users to
identify wildfire threats for a particular area based on landscape
characteristics, historical fire occurrence, weather conditions, terrain and
potential fire behavior. The applications are free to use and can be accessed at
www.texaswildfirerisk.com.

Wildfire's set to dial up a storm

BYLINE: PETER FRIES

SECTION: FEATURES; Pg. 58

LENGTH: 740 words


THERE'S a new kid on the telecommunications block with a very unusual name -
Wildfire.

It's the first of what promises to be an entire generation of "virtual
secretaries" that can handle a variety of communication activities in much the
same way as their human counterparts.

Using voice-recognition technology, Wildfire lets subscribers issue verbal
commands to screen and place calls, store and manage an electronic address book,
answer and route calls to any phone, and create conference calls involving as
many as five people.

Wildfire can also remind users of important messages and appointments and can
even provide a wake-up call to any phone in the world.

All these functions can be performed with one phone call, according to a
Wildfire Communications spokeswoman, Ms Leslie Anderson.

For example, a Wildfire user can make one phone call from a public phone to
connect to Wildfire, then use the service, on the same call, to talk in
succession with several clients whose numbers Wildfire finds and dials; schedule
several meetings; and create a reminder for a dinner date.

Ms Anderson told The Australian the service was most popular with businesses
with fewer than 20 employees.

"It is designed for people who travel extensively and need to communicate on a
real-time basis," she said.

Clients include real-estate consultants, physicians and salespeople.

Wildfire's functions are available when a user begins a Wildfire session.

Normally, Wildfire just "sits in the background" of a user's phone conversation
waiting to be called by name.

With a speaker-independent vocabulary based on North American accents, Wildfire
then responds to 150 commands, which the user trains it to respond to.

The training is accomplished via an online tutorial - usually within two or
three days, according to the company.

In addition to common telephone tasks, the system also has some unusual
features, including the ability to whisper the name of a new caller in your ear
while you are on another call.

The service also includes a virtual hallway where colleagues in concurrent
Wildfire sessions can virtually "bump into each other" even though they may be
in separate countries.

Wildfire can tell users who is in the "hallway" and who is on a call, then
connect any person in the "hallway" to any other person.

Wildfire is the brainchild of Mr Bill Warner, who developed the idea in 1992
after experiencing frustration using a car phone.

His goal was to design a product that would know where you were and have enough
intelligence to handle many communication tasks.

Users have also discovered innovative ways, unforeseen by the development
engineers, to use the product.

Subscribers have used Wildfire to call them in foreign countries where networks
or pricing are subordinate to the US.

Subscribers can then make all their calls to clients through the one Wildfire
phone call.

The service has also had some interesting social consequences.

One client, Ms Anderson said, was just a bit miffed when Wildfire received more
Christmas cards than he did.

The Wildfire service is priced in a similar manner to mobile phone services,
with a monthly fee plus a charge based on the number of minutes the service is
used.

For one person, the service costs between $US150 ($190) and $US200 a month,
excluding telecommunication charges.

It is available only in the US (although Wildfire can handle calls from anywhere
in the world), but OneTel will offer the service in Australia later this year.

While some companies used Wildfire as a receptionist, Ms Anderson said that most
retained their secretaries, who were freed from repetitive telephone work.

The company will launch an updated version of the software with fax and e-mail
capabilities in the fourth quarter of this year.

Although privately held, the company is 12 per cent owned by AT & T Wireless,
which hopes to release a network version.

But the director of Apple's advanced prototyping lab, Mr Frank Casanova,
believes Wildfire has already had a "profound impact" on the way he thinks about
data.

Wildfire's ability to easily maintain a single phone list is one of the most
creative functions, he believes.

Mr Casanova also believes Wildfire is "a signpost pointing in right direction"
for the next wave of computing, where hardware shrinks to the point where it is,
like Wildfire itself, in the background.

Washington: Crapo, Risch, Western Senators Introduce Bill to Improve Fire
Recovery and Mitigation Efforts

LENGTH: 1016  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Mike Crapo has issued the following news
release:
U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jon Tester (D-MT), Jim
Risch (R-ID), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) introduced the Wildfire Mitigation Assistance
Act to provide resources to assist communities recovering from damaging
wildfires. The bill treats wildfires in the same manner as other natural
disasters by making available Hazard Mitigation Assistance funding to states
affected by catastrophic wildfires.


The measure would provide states affected by wildfires access to the Hazard
Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) through the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).  HMGP funds would allow states to implement tactics that diminish
damages caused by wildfires, and also to carry out plans to prevent future
wildfires.  Different from last week's announcement that the Office of
Management recommended funding to replace the more than $570 million transferred
away in this year's fire season from forest restoration accounts to fight a
record fire season, the Wildfire Mitigation Assistance Act would direct FEMA
funding to wildfire prevention activities.
"Throughout the American west, we have felt firsthand the devastation wildfires
have on our habitat, our health and our way of life," Crapo said.  "The Wildfire
Mitigation Assistance Act would allow fire-prone communities to apply for Hazard
Mitigation grants through the Federal Emergency Management Agency in order to
undertake 'fire-wise' projects for homes in the wildland urban interface or to
reduce hazardous fuels.  Congress must continue to pursue efforts aimed at
reducing the risk and severity of wildfires, as well as improve the response,
prevention and mitigation efforts."
"Wildfires have catastrophic effects across the West," Bennet said. "We can
dramatically reduce the severity and damage from these wildfires through
mitigation work that minimizes the risk of flooding, erosion, and future fires.
This bill would make it easier for affected communities to receive federal
resources for post-fire recovery and mitigation efforts."
"Massive wildfires destroy homes, businesses, and ecosystems in the west just
like catastrophic hurricanes destroy communities in coastal regions," said
Risch. "This bill will help local governments in Idaho and across the west deal
with the aftermath of large wildfires."
"I have seen firsthand the impact that catastrophic wildfires have on our
communities," Tester said. "Folks impacted by wildfire need assistance long
after the flames stop burning, and this bill will help ensure that folks on the
ground can restore land impacted by fire and better prevent future disasters."

"Wildfires have unfortunately proven once again to be the West's natural
disasters," Wyden said. "This is urgent business that requires an equally urgent
and comprehensive response. This bill marks a key piece of that response to help
people recover from the devastation of wildfires by providing funding to local
governments to reduce flooding and erosion after fires, monitor stream and
habitat health and assist residents in clearing brush from around their homes
and businesses."
Background on the Wildfire Mitigation Assistance Act:
Currently, states can receive hazard mitigation funding to lessen the effects of
a future disaster only after the president declares a major disaster. However,
unlike in the case of hurricanes, floods, or tornados, most wildfires do not
receive a major disaster declaration. This bill will allow states affected by
wildfires to access the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) to implement
measures that reduce the risk of flooding and erosion and take actions to
prevent future wildfires.
Bennet first introduced this measure as part of the PREPARE Act in 2015. Last
week, Bennet, Crapo, Wyden, and Risch attended a briefing with U.S. Agriculture
Secretary Sonny Perdue to press the issue. Last month, Bennet introduced the
Wildfire Disaster Act of 2017 and sent a bipartisan letter urging Senate Leaders
McConnell (R-KY) and Charles Schumer (D-NY) to include a wildfire funding fix in
any future disaster aid legislation.
Statements of support for the legislation:
"Wildfires continue to wreak tremendous damage across our Western landscapes and
communities," said Roy Charles Brooks, President of National Association of
Counties. "They threaten public safety, pollute the air, foul our waters and
disrupt economic and recreational activity. The Wildfire Mitigation Assistance
Act would help focus resources - federal, state and local - to prevent and
recover from wildfires. Counties thank Senators Bennet, Crapo, Risch, Tester and
Wyden for their leadership on this crucial issue."
"I thank Senator Bennet for introducing this important legislation," said Fire
Chief Thomas Jenkins, President and Chairman of the Board of International
Association of Fire Chiefs. "Flooding and landslides can be a serious threat to
communities already suffering from major wildland fire damage. This bill will
help communities prevent further damage from these natural disasters. The IAFC
supports this legislation and urges Congress to pass it."
"While we are frequently judged based on response and criticized based on
recovery, mitigation and preparedness are critical phases of emergency
management and they most often occur outside the spotlight," said Robie
Robinson, former President of the U.S. Council of the International Association
of Emergency Managers. "As mitigation is the linchpin of emergency management,
expanding hazard mitigation grant funding following a Fire Management Assistance
Grant declaration will enable jurisdictions to implement programs that will
effectively reduce risks and return benefits many fold."
"Mitigation projects have been essential to our recovery from 2012's High Park
Fire," said Lew Gaiter III, Larimer County Commissioner. "This legislation will
give communities the resources to reduce the risk of post-fire flooding and
property damage and help support the long-term recovery of communities affected
by wildfires."

'We could see our own wildfires in the UK according to climate change
predictions'

BYLINE: Jim Durkin

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 343 words


FIREFIGHTERS from across the country will be joined by their American
counterparts at the UK Wildfire Conference in Bournemouth next month.

This conference, set for the Royal Bath Hotel, has been announced as California
struggles in the grip of the most lethal outbreak of wildfires in its history.

At least 35 people are dead, hundreds are missing, more than 90,000 evacuated
and 3,500 buildings destroyed as a series of wildfires devastate communities in
northern California.

Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service (DWFRS) watch manager Andy Elliott
only recently returned from California, after spending three weeks working as a
wildfire tactical advisor.

Andy, who is station commander at Maiden Newton fire station, said: "Climate
change predictions are suggesting that we may see more extreme wildfire
conditions in the UK.

"Southern Europe has suffered its most destructive wildfire season ever and this
is slowly coming our way.

"It is important that UK firefighters learn lessons from other parts of the
world to help us prepare for our own wildfires."

During his time in America Andy rode with fire crews, attending several
incidents including a number of wildfires. He received training on their
equipment and learned new wildfire techniques, as well as completing his USA
Wildfire qualifications.

As part of his visit, Andy also explored the psychological effects wildfires
have on people and communities as well as learning how they and the forests
recover.

DWFRS chief fire officer Ben Ansell said: "We hope that the conference will
generate a wide debate on the issues around wildfire resilience in the UK and
lead to action, if required, to resolve any issues identified.

"In light of the recent wildfire tragedies around the world, it is appropriate
for key stakeholders within the UK to review our position on wildfires, to
ensure that we are well-prepared to meet the challenges posed by our present and
future climate and fuels."

The conference is scheduled for November 7-8.

Panhandle entering wildfire season

BYLINE: Chris Olwell, The News Herald, Panama City, Fla.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 384 words


April 14--PANAMA CITY -- The Panhandle is entering the peak months for wildfire
activity, but the good news is there have been fewer fires over fewer acres this
year compared to the same time last year.

Last year, from Jan. 1 through April 13, 159 wildfires burned more than 1,800
acres, compared to 79 fires that have burned about 1,400 acres this year,
according to the Florida Forest Service's data for the Chipola Fire District,
which includes Bay, Calhoun, Gulf, Holmes, Jackson, Walton and Washington
counties.

"This year, as far as the numbers go, is not as busy as it was last year," said
Forestry Service spokesman Brian Goddin. "If you put us on a five-tier scale ...
we're somewhere in the middle."

Last year, the Chipola District experienced sustained drought that had
firefighters racing from one spot to the next, but so far the drought is over
and the region is adequately saturated, according to the Keetch-Byram Drought
Index, a formula forestry officials use for predicting wildfire conditions.

Last week, smoke from a large wildfire in the Osceola National Forest drifted
about 200 miles into Bay County. That fire is the largest in the state currently
and actually accounts for 85 percent of the actively burning acreage in the
state, Goddin said. He said there should be no issues with smoke in the area
this weekend.

Currently, there are no special restrictions on outdoor burning of yard debris,
he said.

This week was Wildfire Awareness Week, so Goddin has been doing interviews with
media outlets in an effort to raise awareness about the causes of wildfires.

"At least in our area, the No. 1 cause of wildfires has been escaped yard fire
debris," Goddin said.

Lightning is the main cause of naturally occurring wildfires, causing between 20
and 25 percent of wildfires, which means 75 to 80 percent of wildfires are
caused by humans, Goddin said. After wildfires caused accidentally by escaped
debris, intentionally set fires are the main source of wildfires, Goddin said.

There have been several intentionally set wildfires in the Chipola District and
Bay County already this year and several late last year, although none have been
large.

West Region Wildfire Council Receives Award to Reduce Wildfire Risk in the
Region

BYLINE: San Miguel Basin Forum staff

LENGTH: 552  words


The West Region Wildfire Council (WRWC) was recently awarded $171,000 from the
Bureau of Land Management to assist communities on the western slope in reducing
wildfire risk.

The award is part of the BLM's Community Assistance program to reduce the risk
and impact of wildfire on communities within Colorado through planning,
hazardous fuels reduction, mitigation, and education activities.

The West Region Wildfire Council supports interagency efforts to develop and
implement plans to mitigate the threat of catastrophic wildland fire to
communities and natural resources in Delta, Gunnison, Hinsdale, Montrose, Ouray
and San Miguel counties.

The WRWC promotes information sharing and collaboration between local
communities and state and federal fire managers for fuels management, wildfire
suppression, enhancing capaHlity, planning and collaboration.

During the past few years the WRWC has worked with six counties on the western
slope to develop county-wide Community Wildfire Protection Plans (CWPPs).

Most recently, the WRWC has worked with Delta, Gunnison, Montrose, and Ouray
Counties to complete their CWPPs.

A CWPP is a synthesis of known conditions and wildfire history; combined with a
determination of wildfire risk across each of the counties.

The science-based result of the plan is a prescription of where and how to treat
the areas of greatest wildfire risk in each county.

"The CWPP is a starting point for communities to begin working on wildfire risk
redaction and the creation of fire-adapted communities across the landscape,"
says Lilia Colter, the West Region Wildfire Council's CWPP

Coordinator.

"These plans are a stepping off point to begin to work with communities to
reduce their risk through education and wildfire fuel reduction activities."

To help ensure the success of the CWPPs, the WRWC is offering private landowners
and collective groups of private landowners the opportunity to apply for funding
assistance to implement recommendations outlined in approved CWPPs.

The goal of these funds is to assist in completing site specific fuels
mitigation and/or landscape scale fuels reduction projects.

The WRWC Community Assistance funds are a 90/10 cost-share reimbursement
opportunity. For more information about wildfire mitigation grant opportunities
contact:

Lilia Colter(wrwc.lilia(r)gmail.com<mailto: wrwc.lilia(r) gmail.com>) or (970)
240-9051.

"This award is the catalyst to bring together regional efforts of planning to
reduce wildfire risk and actually implementing projects on the ground that will
increase life safety," said Chris Barth, Fire Mitigation & Education Specialist
for the Montrose Interagency Fire Management Unit.

The BLM has been working cooperatively with recipients to help mitigate wildfire
risk; provide fire safety education and training; and plan for catastrophic
wildfire events, within, or in the vicinity of BLM-managed lands in Colorado.

Community Assistance awards support fire departments, local governments,
community service organizations, educational institutions and non-profit
organizations throughout Colorado.

We all share in wildfire prevention

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A23

LENGTH: 658  words


Wildfire prevention is a responsibility we all share and it is important to
understand safe fire practices so that everyone can enjoy Alberta's forests.

Wildfire is not an individual agency's concern - it is a community concern that
requires that all individuals become involved in solutions.

Everyone's involvement ensures that wildfire does not needlessly threaten our
environment. To accomplish this, individuals need to be aware of the dangers of
wildfire to themselves and their community.

To reduce the number of humancaused wildfires, Alberta's Forestry Division has
an extensive wildfire prevention program that targets: Communities Industry
Other Stakeholders Property Owners The General Public The wildfire prevention
program is based on the principals of the two-E's, and these two principles play
a vital role in wildfire prevention: Education: Wildfire Compliance Program
Engineering: Wildfire Prevention Engineering These two principles have an
important role in reaching out to everyone to ensure that they understand the
message being conveyed.

Each category has several guiding principles with the general message that all
prevention programs need to capture the public's interest.

Protection Wildfire plays an important role in creating healthy and vibrant
forests, however, when wildfires burn out of control, they can pose a threat to
important values.

Wildfire prevention engineering is achieved in Alberta through the FireSmart
program.

FireSmart is the proactive way to balance the many natural benefits of wildfire
with the need to protect Alberta's homes, communities and important natural
resources. FireSmart achieves this balance through: Community Protection
Developing Community Partnerships (FireSmart) Landscape Management Prescribed
Fire To reduce the impact of wildfire, FireSmart promotes partnerships among
industry, homeowners and all levels of government. Most notably, the FireSmart
program has flourished through its partnerships with Partners in Protection and
Alberta Emergency Management Agency. Partners in Protection The department has
been instrumental in the creation and evolution of this globally recognized
association dedicated to raising awareness, providing information and delivering
forums to address common problems.

Partners in Protection's activities encourage community-based initiatives to
reduce the risk of fire losses and enhance safety in the wildland urban
interface. For more information, visit: Partners in Protection Alberta Emergency
Management Agency The Alberta Emergency Management Agency (AEMA) leads the
coordination, collaboration and cooperation of all organizations involved in the
prevention of, preparedness for and response to disasters and emergencies. For
more information, visit: Alberta Emergency Management Agency (AEMA) The use of
social marketing as a way to promote these efforts will help Albertans to
protect their communities from the threat of wildfire. Compliance and
Investigation Fire prevention includes the enforcement of legislation and law.

Forestry Division has the authority to seek an order for a fire ban or forest
closure and developed the Enforcement Program to provide the Forest Protection
Branch with the resources required to enforce the provisions of the Forest and
Prairie Protection Act and related legislation. Forest and Prairie Protection
Act The Enforcement Program supports the efforts of staff in the field by
providing training and guidance in investigation methodology and procedures. The
program uses the expertise of highly trained investigators to conduct wildfire
investigations. Dedicated lawyers representing Forestry Division support the
program by providing legal services in both civil litigation and regulatory
prosecutions.

The program is also responsible for investigating suspected arson activity in
the Forest Protection Area and for investigating other related offences contrary
to the provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada.

Wildfire Dance Competition Teams preview routines at Lakeside

BYLINE: Dave Deluca, Star Beacon, Ashtabula, Ohio

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 583 words


Jan. 30--ASHTABULA TOWNSHIP -- Over 200 parents, friends and dance choreography
fans crowded into Lakeside High School Gymnasium for a preview of the Wildfire
Dance Competition Teams' competitive dance season on Sunday.

Wildfire Competitive Dance Teams began over 30 years ago in Conneaut. Although
the dance teams are based in Ashtabula, they consist of members from all over
northeastern Ohio.

The locally based Wildfire Dance Teams are the reigning National Champions for
Showcase America. Sunday's event was a kickoff for their competitive season,
which runs from January to April, said Wildfire choreographer and instructor of
four years Krystle Sleigh.

"These are the routines we'll be using during the competitive dance season," she
said. "Parents and fans are getting a first hand taste of this year's Wildfire
dance routines."

Dance instructor and wildfire choreographer of four years Scott DeCola said the
day was important because it was a snapshot of what the lineup for next week
will be.

"Next week in Westerville, Ohio, near Columbus, is where the season actually
begins," he said. "We're letting the local fans see what's in store."

Wildfire Director Mary Murtha said she started the dance teams 37 years ago in
Conneaut.

"We have 300 girls right now," she said. "They are ages 3 to 18. There are 200
regular dancers and 100 competitive dancers. All dance styles, as well as
acrobatics, are incorporated into the routines."

Murtha said the Lakeside audience would be seeing some new routines for the
first time.

She said there were other new things in store this year for Wildfire.

"We've added some new instructors," she said. "We're also looking forward to our
new dance studio at the Ashtabula Mall. We now have more routines and more
diverse dance styles, like Hip-hop and others."

She said the Lakeside preview also included new, never seen before costumes.

Scott DeCola said the girls would be competing in seven different categories in
Columbus. He said they compete all over the state and in other states as well.

"They were named national champions in Kentucky last year," he said. "We believe
this could be another great year."

Wildfire Dance Team Captain Lacey Rohm of Ashtabula, a senior at Lakeside High
School, said she has been with Wildfire for 13 years -- even though she is now
only 17.

"I started early with Wildfire," she said. "I love dance and I love dancing with
my friends. My friends at Wildfire are more like family. I love being part of
this amazing team. It has changed my life."

Captain McKenna Gebhardt of Conneaut, a 17-year-old junior at Conneaut High
School, has been with Wildfire for 14 years. She also said Wildfire has been a
major part of her life and doesn't know what she would do without it.

"I'm really looking forward to competition this season," she said. "Wildfire has
a lot to offer, especially the new routines like Hip-hop. We're improving in
everything. It should be a great year."

Carrie Aiken, of the Wildfire Fan Club, said the club offered refreshments at
the performance to help defray costs of costumes, scenery, pom-poms and  other
needed extras for the troupe.

"We're a non-profit group and we give back what we make on refreshments to
benefit Wildfire," she said. "There's also a 'no-show' reverse raffle. We do
what we can to make it easier for Widlfire and to support the competition
teams."

Guest commentary: Congress must move on wildfire prevention funding

BYLINE: By Toni Atkins, guest commentary © 2015 Bay Area News Group

SECTION: OPINION; Columnists

LENGTH: 633 words


When it comes to wildfires, California is ground zero.

This year, wildfires in California have consumed thousands of acres of land,
destroyed more than 1,900 homes and led to the tragic loss of eight lives. Over
that time period, the state has spent almost $360 million trying to put out
wildfires, including the Rocky, Butte and Valley fires that ravaged Northern
California communities.

California has stepped up to the plate; we've deployed 5,875 firefighters from
across the state and we've suppressed 307,435 acres of burning land. And we'll
continue to move families safely away if they're in danger.

But we need our federal partners to do more.

Today, the U.S. Forest Service spends more than half of its annual budget on
fire suppression, compared to just 16 percent in 1995. The dramatic increase in
fire suppression spending means that spending on fire prevention has
precipitously declined. For those of us charged with balancing the state budget,
we know that the declining federal investment in prevention means increased
frequency, severity and cost of future wildfires.

That's why in August I authored a resolution at the National Conference of State
Legislatures (NCSL) to support federal policy changes that free up new
investments in wildfire prevention activities, such as the Wildfire Disaster
Funding Act.

The resolution was adopted unanimously with strong bipartisan support and will
allow the NCSL to advocate on behalf of these important policy changes, throwing
the weight of all 50 state legislatures behind it.

Archaic budgeting at the federal level makes new investments in fire prevention
difficult. Both President Barack Obama and U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell
have expressed to Congress the need for changing how catastrophic wildfire
suppression is funded. California congressional leaders, including Sen. Dianne
Feinstein and Congressman Ken Calvert, recognize the environmental and economic
impact of ensuring new funding for wildfire prevention and are working to reform
the system by supporting the bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act.

With fires that rage across the West, federal land management agencies are
running out of money. In August, the U.S. Forest Service had to transfer $250
million from non-fire suppression programs just to ensure that burning fires
could be put out. This makes sense in the short term, but by doing this year
after year, federal agencies and Congress neglect much-needed investments in
fire prevention.

While wildfire season is about over, wildfires are expected to continue burning
stronger and longer due to climate change. Gov. Jerry Brown has recently
declared a state of emergency on account of California's dying tree population
caused by the historic drought, which will likely exacerbate wildfires.

The Wildland Fire Management Program has stated that Southern California will
have above-normal, significant fire potential as the drought continues and
wildfires continue to rage on across California.

The threat remains, and while el niño may bring rainfall, it may also bring the
danger of debris flows from mudslides and flashfloods to regions where wildfires
had burned. Just as with the drought, we cannot rely on El Niño to be a catchall
solution to protect us against wildfires.

Congress must act now. Every day, firefighters risk their lives to stop the
spread of disastrous wildfires, while states and the federal government struggle
to find funding to fight bigger and more dangerous wildfires.

We owe it to the brave men and women on the fire lines and the families being
displaced to pass the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act and ensure that there is
sufficient funding for the suppression and prevention of wildfires.

Toni Atkins, D-San Diego, is California Assembly speaker and represents the 78th
Assembly District.

Ohio: Ohio Crews in Montana to Fight Wildfires

LENGTH: 410  words



Columbus: Ohio Department of Natural Resources has issued the following news
release:
A 20-person Ohio wildfire crew from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources
(ODNR) left Saturday morning to travel to the Lolo National Forest in Montana,
where they will assist with fighting the Burdette Fire. Additionally, a wildfire
crew consisting of three people and one wildfire engine departed Saturday to
travel to Miles City, Montana, where they will be dispatched to help fight
wildfires in the region.


This is the second 20-person hand crew and the second wildfire engine crew with
three people and one wildfire engine assigned to head out West to help fight
wildfires.
"As activity increases in other regions of the country, we are often called upon
to share our experienced wildfire-fighting personnel," said Robert Boyles,
Ohio's state forester. "We always value the time spent on these large fires, and
we are able to apply the knowledge we gain out-of-state to wildfires and other
incidents we face in Ohio."
The Ohio crew and engine are among the many eastern wildland firefighters
recently sent to Montana to assist with managing newly started fires in the
northern Rocky Mountains. The first Ohio wildfire crew sent out West returned
from their assignment after fighting wildfires in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
Additionally, a wildfire crew consisting of three people and one wildfire engine
also returned after traveling to Phoenix, Arizona.
The ODNR Division of Forestry trains ODNR, federal, and private natural resource
agencies as well as fire department personnel from across the state for
inter-agency wildland fire detail and emergencies to protect life and property
in Ohio; manage natural resources using prescribed fire; and to provide
assistance to other states as part of the national effort.
Ohio crews and individual management personnel have assisted with hurricanes,
floods and wildfire incidents since 1986. Crews and overhead staff are normally
dispatched out-of-state for two-week assignments. Travel and wage costs are
reimbursed by requesting agencies.
The ODNR Division of Forestry also coordinates agreements and wildfire training,
prevention, suppression and enforcement with 322 fire departments in the
southern and eastern part of the state and around Maumee State Forest in the
state's northwest corner.

Bennet, Gardner Send Colorado-Written Report on Fire Mitigation to USDA
Secretary

LENGTH: 1122  words

DATELINE: Washington


Office of The Senator Michael Bennet, U.S Government has issued the following
news release:

Colorado U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and Cory Gardner sent the Innovations in
Forestry and Fire Mitigation report to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary
Tom Vilsack. The report commissioned by Bennet details recommendations from
Colorado fire and forestry experts on the steps the federal government can take
to better support Colorado's wildfire mitigation efforts. The senators presented
these recommendations by representatives from the U.S. Forest Service, the
Bureau of Land Management, Colorado State University, the Colorado Water
Congress, County Commissioners from across the Front Range and West Slope, and
other members of the forestry, conservation, and wildfire prevention community
in May of this year.

In a letter accompanying the report, the senators wrote: "As you know, Colorado
has experienced a number of truly devastating wildfires over the last five years
and the frequency of such disasters is likely to increase in the future. While
we remain focused on solving the major funding issues addressed in the Wildfire
Disaster Funding Act, this report outlines additional steps that can be taken to
address wildfire danger at federal, state, and community levels."

A diverse group of experts made these recommendations. They represent a broad
spectrum of interests and have an impressive collective history of working
closely with the USFS to achieve fire mitigation goals."

In March 2014, Bennet convened a large group of Colorado leaders in forestry and
fire mitigation to discuss ways the federal government can best work to support
collaborative, on the ground fire protection and forest health efforts. The
group spent a day with Senator Bennet and USDA Under Secretary for Natural
Resources and Environment Robert Bonnie, discussing their real-world experiences
working in Colorado forests and communities.

At Bennet's request, the group then worked together to develop the detailed
report on the outcomes from that conversation, with specific recommendations for
federal policy.

Recommendations included:

o Focusing on collaborative decision-making processes that advance conversations
between federal decision makers and community leaders to address wildfire
prevention, forest management, and regulatory processes.
o Increasing education and outreach to homeowners and communities regarding
their responsibility to mitigate fuels and property conditions and the actual
risk of wildfire.
o Investing in preparedness, collaborative planning, capacity building, and
proactive work before wildfires occur.
o Investing federal resources to support community forest health and wildfire
prevention leadership.
o Encouraging land management agencies to evaluate their current work and
develop new methods that focus on effectiveness across the landscape.
o Requesting that federal forest planning information be more accessible to
local and regional groups engaged in complementary work.

Bennet has long advocated for a smarter approach to handling wildfires. In 2013,
he chaired a subcommittee hearing to bring attention to shrinking budgets for
mitigation efforts and to reform the way we fund wildfire fighting efforts. He
has worked tirelessly to attract critical federal resources to help combat
wildfires, mitigate their effects, and modernize our air tanker fleet. Bennet
has led efforts to secure Emergency Watershed Protection resources to help
Colorado communities recover from previous catastrophic fires, and authored key
forest health and wildfire prevention provisions in the Senate Farm Bill. He
authored the PREPARE Act to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) to establish a funding stream specifically for wildfire mitigation and
award competitive grants to states to prioritize wildfire mitigation and
preparedness projects on federal, state, and private lands. He also is a
cosponsor of the bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which seeks to solve
the wildfire borrowing problem by treating large, catastrophic fires as natural
disasters.

Senator Gardner's leadership on wildfires goes back to his time in the House of
Representatives. In 2013, he took on members of his own party to advocate for
disaster assistance to victims of Colorado wildfires, and was able to secure a
commitment from appropriation Chairman Hal Rogers to support funding for
Emergency Watershed Protection in future legislation. Later that year, he
participated in a House field hearing in the Colorado State Capitol on wildfire
prevention. Gardner was also a co-sponsor of H.R. 3992, the Wildfire Disaster
Funding Act of 2014 and H.R. 818, the Healthy Forest Management and Wildfire
Prevention Act. In the Senate, he quickly signed on as a cosponsor of S. 235,
the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act of 2015.

Dear Secretary Vilsack:

We write you to pass along the attached report, "Innovations in Forestry and
Fire Mitigation." This report is the product of collaboration between many of
Colorado's most experienced leaders on these issues. It contains a number of
recommendations that could help to leverage existing federal funds to increase
the pace and scale of collaborative fire mitigation and forest restoration where
it is needed most urgently.

As you know, Colorado has experienced a number of truly devastating wildfires
over the last five years and the frequency of such disasters is likely to
increase in the future. While we remain focused on solving the major funding
issues addressed in the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, this report outlines
additional steps that can be taken to address wildfire danger at federal, state,
and community levels.

Although the suggestions in this report address a wide range of agencies and
jurisdictions, the majority are focused on the United States Forest Service
(USFS). A diverse group of experts made these recommendations. They represent a
broad spectrum of interests and have an impressive collective history of working
closely with the USFS to achieve fire mitigation goals. One key recommendation
that is reiterated throughout the report is the need to reconsider the way that
the USFS evaluates forestry success. The report suggests that a focus on the
quality of acres treated, rather than simply the quantity of treated acreage,
may increase overall success. We hope that you will view this and other
recommendations as constructive feedback from valuable partners, and seek ways
to implement and incorporate them into your operations wherever possible. We are
committed to working with you to achieve this goal.

Controlled burns are a great way to protect forest lands, prevent wildfires

BYLINE: Tiffany Thompson, The Stanly News & Press, Albemarle, N.C.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 1145 words


July 15--The U.S. Forestry Service is reporting that 2011 has been an active
year for wildfires. Between Jan. 1 and June 30, more than 37,500 wildfires have
been reported across the nation, burning nearly 4.9 million acres, according to
information released by the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) in Boise,
Idaho. In comparison to the same six-month time period of previous years, 2011
has seen the most wildfires of the last 10 years.

Currently, there are 20 active large wildfires burning nearly 533,000 acres
across 11 states. While Texas is reporting the most large wildfires with seven
and New Mexico and Georgia are reporting three, North Carolina is among the
states experiencing large wildfires.

As of July 5, two large wildfires were reported in North Carolina, according to
the NIFC. The first is located along Juniper Road approximately 13 miles
northeast of Rocky Mount where more than 31,000 acres are burning. The second is
located along Simmons Road, which is about nine miles northeast of Tar Heel.
There are approximately 5,100 acres burning in this large wildfire, which is
threatening residences and evacuations have taken effect.

The North Carolina Forestry Service, as a way to protect forest lands from large
wildfires, has been conducting controlled burns throughout the state for many
years.

According to Don Little, county ranger for the Stanly County Forestry Service,
regular controlled burning reduces the fuel load -- or build up of grass,
leaves, pine straw and other forest debris -- allowing firefighters to suppress
a wildfire much quicker than they would have otherwise.

"When the fuel load is built up, wildfire can spread much quicker, making them
more difficult to suppress. By doing these controlled burns, it makes it easier
in the event a wildfire would start, though it does not completely get rid of
the risk of a wildfire," Little said.

In addition to reducing fuel load, control burns help to maintain habitats for
protected animals and plants, many of which are native to the Stanly County area
but without the ability to protect their habitat, they could become endangered.

"Not only do these burns help to reduce the chance of having a wildfire, but it
also benefits the wildlife in the area by opening up the forest floor and
providing for new plant growth," Little said.

According to Little, fires once occurred naturally across North Carolina.
Low-intensity fires burned every few years, fueled by grass, leaves, pine straw,
and other forest debris. They kept the forest open, allowing sunlight to
penetrate to its floor and reducing buildup of dangerous fuel loads. Fire
suppression altered the landscape, allowing fuels to accumulate and putting
people and communities in jeopardy.

There are many fire-dependent ecosystems across the state from the mountains to
the coast, including most oak and pine forests. Without fire, many native plants
and animals would disappear due to lack of food, habitat and conditions needed
for them to exist.

One of the most recent controlled burns in Stanly County took place on property
owned by ALCOA near the Tuckertown Waste Water Treatment plant. The goal of this
burn was to remove the threat of trees growing tall enough to become entangled
in or possibly fall on power lines located on the property.

Marshall Olsen, environmental and natural resource manager for ALCOA, explained
that controlled burns are a great asset to have, especially when they are done
properly.

"By burning, wildlife can benefit because it allows for the native brush species
to grow, which provides a palpable area for food and shelter for wildlife.
Burning is a great tool when the pros do the work," Olsen said.

Controlled burning participants receive extensive training to ensure that they
are careful to protect surrounding communities, themselves and the land they are
working to restore. Fire experts do a great deal of work before the burn. They
create a burn plan, which includes smoke management details, fire control
measures, acceptable wea-ther parameters, and equipment and personnel needs.

As an example, Little explained that smoke management would include taking into
account where any hospitals, schools or heavily populated areas are and they
factor in the amount of wind.

"We always take wind speeds and direction into account. If we plan a controlled
burn for a certain day, but the day is too windy, we have to reschedule," Little
said.

"We take a lot of pains to make sure our site prep and burn plan take into
account every factor that could affect the burn."

Little added that the plan also details how the ecosystem will benefit from
fire.

The weather is often one of the biggest factors because if the area has been dry
due to drought conditions, burning is not an option. Not only is there a
possibility of the fire spreading too quickly, but trees in drought-heavy areas
are already under stress due to the lack of water. A fire would add unnecessary
stress.

Also, the wind can play an important part in whether crews decide to conduct a
controlled burn because if it is too windy, gusts could carry embers across the
fire suppression line causing pocket areas, called spot overs, not included in
the burn plan.

"Every detail of the burning process has to be laid out before we start to make
sure that there is a slim possibility of things getting out of hand," Little
said.

Little joked that they often have numerous people calling to report smoke in
areas where they are conducting controlled burns.

"These fires do put out a lot of smoke. Sometimes it looks like the whole world
is on fire," Little said.

These controlled burns also help to serve as training mechanisms for other
departments. Crews from the State Medical Assistance Team (SMAT) helped the
Forestry Service during the Tuckertown burn, which Michael Roark, fire marshal
for the county, explained is a common occurrence.

"[The Forestry Service] takes the lead on these controlled burns, but they often
invite us out for assistance," Roark said, adding that part of the role of the
SMAT is wildlife fire suppression.

Little also explained that this controlled burning resource is also available to
private landowners through the North Carolina Forestry Service, though there are
selected times throughout the year when this can be done.

controlled burning resources, contact (704) 982-5317.

Chubb Corporation: Chubb Encourages Homeowners to Prepare Early for Wildfires

LENGTH: 345  words


March 31 -- As warmer weather approaches, the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies
is encouraging homeowners to take steps now to help protect their homes from
wildfires.

A prolonged drought in the West has some fire officials worried that 2014 could
bring an increase in wildfires after a drop in such activity last year. In 2013,
47,579 reported wildfires burned 4.3 million acres, compared to 67,774 wildfires
affecting 9.3 million acres in the prior year, according to the National
Interagency Fire Center.



While California and neighboring states have experienced some of the largest
wildfires, the destruction is not confined to the West. In 2013, large wildfires
erupted in Colorado, Texas, Florida, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, among other
states-and not just during the driest and hottest months.

"At one time, wildfires were more likely to start in the late summer and early
fall-and you could warn homeowners about the approaching 'wildfire season,'"
said Christie Alderman, new products and services manager for Chubb Personal
Insurance. "Now, we see wildfires threatening homes throughout the year, and it
means homeowners must be more vigilant."

Alderman said that changing weather patterns may contribute to the unpredictable
wildfire season, but it's also because more people are building homes in the
woods to enjoy the natural beauty of the surroundings. "The downside of living
amid nature is that homes are exposed to nature's wrath, including wildfires,"
she said.

Alderman said homeowners who live in high-risk wildfire areas should assess
whether their properties are adequately protected from a wildfire. Some steps
they can take include:

* Replacing cedar roof shingles with ceramic tiles or other non-flammable
materials;

* Replacing flammable shrubs and bushes with fire-resistant plants;

* Covering the chimney and open vents with wire mesh to prevent embers from
entering the house;

* Moving propane tanks away from the home;

* Removing debris from gutters and beneath decks; and

* Replacing landscaping mulch with stones or other fire-resistive materials.

Commissioners approve development of wildfire protection plan

April 27--PALO PINTO -- Though this month's rainfall has lake levels gradually
rising and plant life green, Palo Pinto County is still at risk of wildfires.

"When you have wildfires occur, especially when you see multiple wildfires
occur, it's a pretty good bet there will be wildfires in the future," said Luke
Kanclerz, Texas A&M Forest Service wildland urban interface specialist II.

On Monday, Kanclerz gave a presentation to Palo Pinto County Commissioners on
the development of a countywide community wildfire protection plan, a plan that
would prepare area firefighters with the knowledge of how to prevent and fight
such wildfires. Such a plan would also give counties material to educate people
about wildfires and their dangers.

Though no one can fully predict where or when a wildfire might occur, the
county's history indicates a significant possibility of more fires in the
future, he said.

"It's best to be prepared to mitigate future loss," he said of establishing a
plan.

Since 2009, the county has experienced some of the worst wildfires in the state,
he said, including wildfires at Possum Kingdom in 2011, in which more than 160
homes and 117,000 acres burned.

In addition, the county is at risk because the region has entered into a 30-year
drought cycle, he said. While there are wet years in this cycle, those years are
split by lengthy periods of drought in which precipitation is minimal.

Moreover, the county falls within the National Weather Service's Southern Plains
Wildfire Outbreak region, characterized by southwesterly winds and dry, unstable
air flowing over parched terrain, he said.

The plan involves the forest service collaborating with local fire departments
and emergency management, assessing the risks of wildfires, prioritizing fuel
reduction and recognizing and reducing risks to structures.

Assessments include marking maps to find out the interface between urban and
wild areas and examining risks such as road conditions, combustible materials,
topography and water availability, he said.

After the presentation, commissioners approved a proclamation to develop a
countywide community wildfire protection plan.

Wildfire: voice mail with a soul;
Road Warrior

BYLINE: Charles Wright

SECTION: COMPUTERS; Pg. 35

LENGTH: 738 words


It's another busy day on the road, and my secretary has tracked me down in the
office of a colleague, according to the schedule I'd given her earlier in the
day. She has called to inform me that she has someone on the line, and to ask
whether I want to take the call or have her take a message.

"It's me, Wildfire," I tell her, reflecting slightly, as I sometimes do, on the
fact that it's somewhat unusual to have a secretary called Wildfire. As it
happens, that's not the only unusual thing about my secretary. Wildfire is
composed entirely of electrons, or more accurately, of bits of data, residing on
a computer hard disk in Sydney. Her intelligence, then, is artificial. It is
also just a little eerie.

"Oh, hi!" she greets me, when I tap in the security code that confirms my
identity. Her tone conveys a feeling of such compelling joy that, I realise, not
for the first time, that I am having a genuine, pleasurable, if highly
andropomorphic relationship with data.

I can understand why Anthony Lovell, the computer engineer who was once the
boyfriend of the original owner of this voice, over there in Lexington,
Massachusetts, used it as the interface to the voice recognition system which is
the core of Wildfire.

In a world in which the secretary is increasingly shared or, in the interests of
fiscal economy, dispensed with entirely, Wildfire is a godsend. If you could
imagine voice mail with personality, you'd have the rudiments of Wildfire. Add
the ability to respond to spoken commands, recognise voices, remember
appointments, manage a phone book, recite messages when asked, put through
important calls and hold all others, and you approach what J.C.R. Licklider, the
psychologist who is probably the real father of the Internet, called the
"symbiosis" between humans and computers.

Have you ever had a computer whisper in your ear while you're on the phone,
inquiring if you'd like to take another call? Say yes, and she'll put the first
call on hold, or patch the three of you into the same conversation, or simply
take a message. Symbiosis.

Wildfire has a sense of humour. The version they run in Lexington yawns if you
ring in the early morning. Inquire of Wildfire "What's a cow say?", and a heifer
bawls at you. Sometimes you just need to know that you're having more than a
purely business relationship.

In this country, your business relationship is with a company called One.Tel,
which heard about Wildfire and introduced it as a bureau service. In the US, you
can buy it outright, in a version that supports 25 users, for $US50,000.
Relatively few companies can afford that.

One.Tel offers two rates - $150 per month buys 500 minutes of session time. $300
gives you 1,500 minutes.

You can spend a lot of time with Wildfire. Call in once, and you can make any
amount of calls, receive those whispers, etc. As you run through your messages,
you can get Wildfire to call each one back, without having to punch in those
numbers.

At the caller end, Wildfire incidentally performs a sorting function. There are
basically two sorts of people. Those who love Wildfire and want to know
everything about it, and those who are, in varying degrees, fearful of it. Those
people sometimes give her the wrong number.

You can also get slightly tangled. In my first few days with Wildfire, when I
was still teaching her to recognise my voice and mastering the vocabulary, I
unwittingly put Wildfire into an endless loop.

When you finish a session, you tell her where you're going to be, or whether
you're on an agreed schedule. I told her I was on my mobile, and then, in one of
those strokes of sheer idiocy, diverted my mobile to Wildfire. Callers who tried
to contact me, found themselves talking to infinite iterations of Wildfire. One
plaintive message told the tragic story: "Oh dear," it said, then hung up.

Wildfire offers the ability to give one number to all your contacts, and then
have Wildfire run the numerical maze between your office number, mobile, home or
guest office.

If you have colleagues who are also using Wildfire, she will also manage a
so-called "Virtual Hallway". That hallway extends beyond your office, or even
international borders.

Ask her "Who's around?", and if the person you want is also in a Wildfire
session, you can be patched through to, say, a call box at an airport in Los
Angeles or London. She makes a pleasant travelling companion.

Now is the time to protect your home from wildfire

BYLINE: The Sun staff

May is Oregon Wildfire Awareness Month! Please be mindful of the growing
potential for wildfires and follow basic fire safety rules and precautions. The
heaviest activity is in the summer, but fires occur all seasons of the year
including spring. During May, state, local and federal fire agencies will be
spreading the word about wildfire prevention and the steps Oregonians can take
to stop most fires before they start.

At stake: lives, property, forests.

When it comes to preventing wildfires, there's a lot at stake -lives, personal
property, and the many values provided by Oregon's forests. In 2013, three
firefighters died battling Oregon wildfires. Timber losses totaled about $370
million, and the fires decimated key fish and wildlife habitats. Homes and
outbuildings were destroyed as well.

Wildfires can start at home.

Wildfires that occur in the wildland-urban interface often are started by human
activity and then spread to the forest. Once underway a fire follows the fuel,
whether it is trees or houses.

"Simple prevention strategies will make the strongest impact in keeping your
home, family and community safe," said Kristin Babbs, president of the Keep
Oregon Green Association.

Spring is the perfect time, she said, to remove dead flammable vegetation and
limb up trees around the backyard.

To get an early start on Wildfire Awareness Month, join your neighbors and
reduce your community wildfire risk by taking part in National Wildfire
Community Preparedness Day on Saturday, May 3. The National Fire Protection
Association has teamed up with State Farm Insurance to encourage residents to
commit a couple of hours, or the entire day, to help raise wildfire awareness
and work together on projects that can help protect homes and entire communities
from the threat of wildfire."Thousands of Oregonian's lives and homes can be put
at risk when a wildfire strikes," reminds Interim Oregon State

Fire Marshal Jim Walker. "I encourage everyone to prepare their home and the
area around their home before wildfire season begins by checking the websites
for Keep Oregon Green and the Oregon Dept. of Forestry."

Coming soon: More Wildfire Awareness Month tips During May, Keep Oregon Green
will promote fire prevention messages on:

CoreLogic: 2013 CoreLogic Wildfire Hazard Risk Report Reveals Wildfires Pose
Risk to More Than 1.2 Million Western U.S. Homes

LENGTH: 883  words


New Delhi, Oct. 10 -- CoreLogic (NYSE: CLGX), a leading residential property
information, analytics and services provider, today released its 2013 CoreLogic
Wildfire Hazard Risk Report. The report identifies more than 1.2 million
residential properties across 13 states in the western U.S. currently at high or
very high risk for wildfire damage, representing a combined total property value
estimated at more than $189 billion. Of the total properties identified, just
over 268,000 homes fall into the "Very High Risk" category alone, with total
residential exposure valued at more than $41 billion.



In addition to providing a property-level categorical risk rating for the total
number and value of homes exposed to wildfires, the CoreLogic Wildfire Risk
Model used to develop the report also assigns a numeric risk score to each
property, ranging from 1 to 100. This separate score indicates the level of
susceptibility to wildfire that accounts for risk not only associated with the
physical property itself, but also located in close proximity to the property
boundary. When expanding the analysis through the CoreLogic Wildfire Risk Score
to include the surrounding area, more than 1.5 million homes are assigned the
highest Wildfire Risk Score (81-100), representing a combined potential property
value of more than $224 billion.

The 2013 CoreLogic Wildfire Hazard Risk Report provides a breakdown of
residential property risk at four geographic levels-regional, state, metro and
ZIP code. The report was developed to provide the insurance industry, financial
services companies, homeowners and others impacted by wildfire outbreaks with a
better understanding of wildfire risk in the U.S.

"Recent trends have proven that the risk of wildfire damage is a real and
immediate threat to many homeowners in the western U.S. Awareness of that risk,
as it relates to homes and businesses, is crucially important to minimizing or
preventing massive property damage," said Dr. Thomas Jeffery, senior hazard
scientist for CoreLogic Spatial Solutions. "Coming off a record-setting year in
2012, the 2013 wildfire season has already presented a number of damaging fires
including the Black Forest Fire in Colorado and the Rim Fire in California. More
importantly, the season is far from over. The next two months could be a
critical time should fires continue to ravage the dry fuel areas in the west, as
ongoing drought conditions in the region continue to exacerbate wildfire risk."

Key findings in the 2013 CoreLogic Wildfire Hazard Risk Report include:

* At the regional level, the Southern Rockies and South Central U.S. contain the
most homes facing wildfire risk, both within the physical property boundaries
and when including risk in close proximity. There are a total of 145,361
properties identified as Very High Risk, and a total of 915,374 properties that
have a risk score higher than 81, indicating the highest level of risk.

* The states most commonly associated with wildfires also contain the most
properties at risk -Colorado, California and Texas are home to the largest
number of properties categorized as Very High Risk, with a combined property
value exceeding $34.5 billion. Including the homes located in the High Risk
category, the total property exposure to risk reaches more than $160 billion for
these three states. When analyzed by risk score, 1,254,487 homes worth more than
$185 billion fall into the highest risk segment of 81-100.

* When considering property-level risk strictly in the Very High category,
Colorado tops the list of states analyzed in the report with a total of 83,174
homes falling into that group. Comparatively, when assigning the Wildfire Risk
Score, Texas takes the top spot with 678,544 homes scoring in the 81-100
high-risk range.

* Of the seven cities analyzed in the report, Los Angeles is home to the most
single-family residences exposed to wildfire risk, with more than 60,000
properties in the High or Very High Risk categories. The total value of the
homes in those two categories is estimated to be nearly $8.3 billion, with
Malibu at the top of the list of ZIP code areas, with more than $700 million in
potential residential property exposure to wildfire risk.

The report also highlights the importance of factoring the Wildland Urban
Interface (WUI) into a comprehensive analysis of wildfire risk, which is the
precise area where urban development and wildland intersect. The report states
that just between the years of 1990 to 2008, there were close to 17 million new
homes built in the U.S., of which 10 million (58 percent) were located in the
WUI and, therefore, potentially exposed to higher wildfire-risk zones.

"As cities grow in population, they tend to expand outward into formerly
undeveloped wildland areas. Just because your home is located within a city
boundary does not necessarily mean you are safe from wildfire destruction if
there is wildland vegetation nearby," said Jeffery. "Wind-blown embers can
travel hundreds or even thousands of feet and ignite homes located far away from
an actual fire. Since much of the expansion on the urban edge consists of
residential properties, an increasing number of newer homes are located in close
proximity to natural wildland areas where the potential for wildfire damage is
much greater.

Update on wildfires around Williams Lake

BYLINE: Monica Lamb-Yorski

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 431 words


An aerial scan of the White Lake wildfire east of the Fraser River done on
Thursday identified some hot spots that crews are extinguishing Friday, said
fire information officer Ali Martin.

"They are also focusing on the northern flank in preparation for southerly winds
predicted for the weekend that could push the fire north potentially," she told
the Tribune Friday.

Estimated to be 4,021 hectares, the White Lake wildfire is being attacked by 94
personnel and 24 pieces of equipment.

The fire is located four kilometres from Commodore Heights and 8.2 km from the
"Y" intersection in Williams Lake, she added.

Wildwood wildfire

An estimated 12,973 ha, the Wildwood Airport wildfire continues to emit smoke
from internal pockets of the fire and there is concern about the northeast area
of the fire so crews are working to secure the guard in that area, Martin said,
noting there are 119 personnel working on the fire presently.

Spokin Lake wildfire

With 123 crew and 16 pieces of equipment, the fight continues on the Spokin Lake
wildfire, especially the northern half of the fire and the southeastern flank.

"Mop-up continues within the perimeter to re-secure the area and we have night
lines in place with sprinklers running all night to help cool the area for the
crews working during the day," Martin said..

Prouton Lakes wildfire

The Prouton Lake wildfire is very active, Martin said.

Estimated to be 365 hectares, the fire is being attacked by 44 firefighters and
16 pieces of heavy equipment.

"They have a second contingency line around the southern, eastern and northern
flanks is under construction at the moment. If the weather allows crews may do
some burnout to help secure the guard because winds are forecasted for
Saturday."

The fire was formerly known as the UBC Research wildfire.

Soda Creek wildfire

The 251-ha. Soda Creek wildfire continues to be monitored by the Cariboo Fire
Centre.

Gavin Lake wildfire

Estimated to be 160 hectares in size, the Gavin Lake wildfire has 21 personnel
and five pieces of heavy equipment attacking it Friday, Aug. 11.

"It is not threatening any structures," Martin said.

Several of the fires are still having air attack, with skimmers working on the
Wildwood, White Lake and Prouton Lake wildfires and bucket operations, skimmers
and air tankers on hand if ground crews call them in, she added.

Martin is from Australia and is one of 180 personnel from that country helping
with wildfires throughout the province. She arrived on July 19 and spent the
first two weeks as the Quesnel Fire Centre.

She will be at the Cariboo Fire Centre until Aug. 23, she said.

Canadians Making Communities Safer Today as Part of First National Wildfire
Community Preparedness Day

LENGTH: 599  words


May 2 -- Today, Canadians are making their communities safer as they participate
in the first National Wildfire Preparedness Day in Canada. Twenty-four groups
across the country received funding to support local mitigation projects aimed
at reducing the risk of wildfire damage in their communities. People of all ages
are invited to come out and participate in the effort.

"We are excited to have people across Canada learning about wildland urban
interface, and the role we all play in creating wildfire resilient communities,"
says Kelly Johnston, Executive Director of Partners in Protection. "We hope that
today's inaugural Canadian National Wildfire Community Preparedness Day will be
the start of a growing annual event that builds awareness and education, and
ultimately reduces the threat of wildfires in Canada."

"We're pleased to work with our partners to educate and raise awareness around
mitigating the risk of wildfires across the country," said Kathy Bardswick,
President and CEO of The Co-operators. "It takes a real community effort to
build resilience to this sort of risk, and that's exactly what's taking place in
dozens of communities today."

"It is wonderful that FireSmart Canada and its partners are supporting
volunteers across the country that are taking action to make their communities
safer and more resilient to damage from wildfire," noted Paul Kovacs, Executive
Director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction at Western University.

"The National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) Wildland Fire Operations
Division is dedicated to helping protect people and property in communities at
risk from wildfire through advocacy, outreach and education" said Shayne Mintz,
Canadian Regional Director of the NFPA. "Fire science research has shown that
community engagement and individual action ahead of time can reduce property
loss and human suffering from wildfires. As the founder of Wildfire Community
Preparedness in the USA, the NFPA is excited to help bring this initiative to
Canada!"

There are a variety of projects taking place today, which span from a short time
commitment to an entire day, which are being undertaken by individuals, families
and groups. Projects include hosting a chipping day, distributing wildfire
safety information to neighbours, organizing brush clean-up and more.

The National Launch for Wildfire Community Preparedness Day will be hosted in
Breslau in the Township of Woolwich, Ontario. "Our Township is honoured to host
the Canadian National Launch for Wildfire Community Preparedness Day in Breslau
today," said Sandy Shantz, Mayor, Township of Woolwich. "Our volunteer
firefighters do an outstanding job of ensuring the safety and well-being of
residents throughout the Township. Through the assistance of the partnering
organizations, this event will help to raise awareness of the dangers related to
Wildfires, especially as it relates to rural areas such as Woolwich."

National Wildfire Community Preparedness Day events help raise awareness of
wildfires, and bring residents of all ages together to work on projects to
protect their homes, neighbourhoods and communities. FireSmart Canada in
collaboration with the National Fire Protection Association, the Institute for
Catastrophic Loss Reduction, and The Co-operators are pleased to bring this
first ever event to Canada. To learn more about the first National Wildfire
Community Preparedness Day in Canada visit www.firesmartcanada.ca

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 281 words


SANTA FE &GT;&GT; As wildfires continue to impact the western United States, a
new guide has been developed to help those impacted by wildfire in New Mexico
start on the path to recovery.

New Mexico State Forestry, along with many interagency partners, has created
this guide and a companion website called "After Wildfire: A Guide for New
Mexico Communities," according to New Mexico Forest and Watershed Health Office
Coordinator Susan Rich, who led the project.

"We developed this guide for New Mexicans affected by wildfire and for the
emergency personnel and civic leaders they turn to in a time of crisis," said
Rich. "The initial request for this guide came from people in the trenches,
individuals helping communities hard-hit by wildfire and post-fire flooding. We
wrote it for them."

Funded in part by the USDA Forest Service, the new After Wildfire New Mexico
Guide and website provides information on subjects such as technical guides to
post-wildfire mitigation and land treatments; links to post-wildfire and
flooding funding and financial tips for individuals and communities; how to
mobilize communities and working with volunteer organizations; post-fire and
flooding safety; and resources for emotional support.

"After Wildfire: A Guide for New Mexico Communities" is now available through
the After Wildfire website:www.afterwildfirenm.org .

In addition to the information found in the new guide, the website provides
links to wildfire guides published by other sources as well as links to social
media sites, active wildfire information, contact information to the agencies
who have contributed information to the guide and materials for fire prevention
and preparedness.

Letter: Worker shortage after fires blamed on Obama really?

BYLINE: Letters From Our Readers

LENGTH: 301 words



HIGHLIGHT: A letter writer manages the clever trick of blaming the shortage of
workers to rebuild after recent wildfires on President Obama. How did he manage
this amazing stunt? First, he says the welfare state boomed during the Obama
years, without mentioning that millions of jobs were lost in the months leading
up to Obamas inauguration. []

Students: Expand city's wildfire zone

BYLINE: Vickie Aldous, Ashland Daily Tidings, Ore.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 772 words


May 28--A class of Southern Oregon University students that inspected Ashland
neighborhoods is recommending that the town expand its wildfire hazard zone.

Members of the spring Planning Issues class broke up into groups to walk the
streets and look for dense tree growth, trees and bushes that were too close to
homes, steep slopes and other hazards that could fuel a wildfire and hasten its
spread.

"These things were not visible unless we actually went out and hit the pavement,
so to speak," said SOU student Carter Franklin, who created draft maps showing
areas where the students think the wildfire zone should be expanded.

The current wildfire zone encompasses about 1,400 homes in the hills high above
Siskiyou Boulevard and Main Street. SOU students said the zone should be pushed
down, closer to those key streets that divide Ashland.

The streets create natural fire breaks, they said.

Additionally, the areas above those roads have steep slopes.

"If you start a fire at the bottom of a slope, it's much more dangerous and much
more likely to work its way uphill," Carter said, adding that extending the
wildfire zone would put more areas with steep slopes inside the zone.

Not all of the hazardous areas in town were in Ashland's hills, the students
found. They have recommended that wildfire zone pockets be designated in the Oak
Knoll area near Exit 14, where a fast-moving 2010 fire destroyed 11 houses.

That area has overgrown vegetation, a ravine and dry grass and weeds in the
summer. Many of the homes that burned also had wood shake roofs.

"We found neighborhood pockets as well as individual homes well outside of the
wildfire zone that should be considered high risk because of construction
materials, vegetation overgrowth and debris that could cause fire to spread more
rapidly where wildfire is unexpected -- as was the case in the Oak Knoll
neighborhood," said student Rikki Pritzlaff.

The students delivered their recommendation to expand the wildfire zone to the
Ashland City Council on May 17. If the council decides to pursue an expanded
zone, that would require a multi-step process that would include notifying
neighbors who would be affected and holding a public hearing.

If the council doesn't want to formally expand the wildfire zone, the students
said the city of Ashland could increase education efforts, especially in the
higher risk areas.

"Throughout this entire project, our class kept going back to the idea that
educating everybody in Ashland was probably one of the most important aspects in
preventing wildfire disasters," said SOU student Alissa Kolodzinski.

Ashland Fire & Rescue Chief John Karns recommended earlier this year that
Ashland explore the idea of an expanded wildfire zone.

Forest Resource Specialist Chris Chambers and FireWise Communities Coordinator
Ali True -- both from the fire department -- helped train the students who
researched the issue.

City of Ashland Geographic Information System Coordinator Jason Wegner aided
students with mapping, said SOU Associate Professor of Geography Pat Acklin, who
teaches the Planning Issues class.

Chambers said the students did outstanding work.

"They did a very professional job and saved us many hours of research and GIS
work," he said. "We're very appreciative of the work they did."

Chambers said an expanded wildfire zone could better protect Ashland by
extending zone regulations to cover more homes.

City officials can't prevent people outside the current zone from replacing
their roofs with flammable wood shake shingles, for example, he said.

"Anybody right on the edge of the wildfire zone could tomorrow change out their
roof to a wood shake roof," Chambers said.

Ashland Fire & Rescue provides free home inspections to assess wildfire safety.
To schedule an appointment, call Ali True at 541-552-2231.

To see if your home is in the existing wildfire zone, visit
www.ashland.or.us/Page.asp?NavID=13511.

That Web page also contains information about how to reduce wildfire risk to
your home and property, whether you are in the current wildfire zone or not.

Maps of the proposed expanded wildfire zone are in a draft stage at this point.
Ashland Fire & Rescue may add or subtract areas from the proposed expanded zone,
Acklin said.

Fire crews battling wildfire south of Houston

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 597 words


FINAL UPDATE:

BC Wildfire Service says the wildfire 40 kilometers south of Houston is no
longer considered to be a wildfire of note and won't be updated anymore.

Although, fire crews continue to work on extinguishing the blaze, they've made
significant progress since it ignited Friday.

The wildfire burning 40 kilometres southwest of Lac La Hache continues to be
fought by firefighters. BC Wildfire Service says it is still classified as
'being held'.

It has also been more accurately mapped to 25.9 hectares in size instead of the
36 hectares as originally thought.

UPDATE: #2:

Fire crews continue to battle a forest fire 40 kilometres south of Houston.

According to the BC Wildfire Service's website, the fire is on the south side of
the Nadina River and 3 kilometres south of Owen Lake. It has been more
accurately mapped to 58 hectares in size and is classified as "under control."
The service goes on the say the fire has received sufficient suppression to
ensure the fire will not spread.

As of Monday morning, there are 80 firefighters and 1 helicopter working the
fire.

The fire that was discovered Friday, had fire crews battling the blaze from the
ground and the air.

Water-bombing planes could be seen at Smithers Regional Airport refueling and
heading to towards Houston on a constant loop.

A man watching planes take off and land at the airport Friday evening said in
the 15 minutes he'd been there, several firefighting planes had landed and taken
off.

No homes or buildings have been threatened by the wildfire, the site states. The
cause of what sparked the blaze is not yet known.

The cause of what sparked the blaze is not yet known.

Officials say lightning is to blame for the wildfire 40 kilometres southwest of
Lac La Hache.

The fire was discovered Friday is an estimated 36 hectares in size. Fire crews
have the blaze contained and have it classified as "being held". Which means the
fire is not expected to grow.

UPDATE #1:

BC Wildfire Service says as of 10:30 a.m. Saturday, the wildfire south of
Houston is now approximately 70 hectares in size.

According to their website, there are 43 firefighters on the ground with nearly

surrounded by firefighters.

There are 50 firefighters on the ground, one helicopter, two heavy equipment
machines, and air tankers battling the fire.

BC Wildfire Service site stated both wildfires don't pose any threat to homes or
buildings. No word yet on what sparked both blazes.

Washington: Bennet, Crapo, Tester, Risch, Wyden Introduce Bill to Improve Fire
Recovery and Mitigation Efforts

LENGTH: 911  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Michael Bennet, U.S Government has issued the
following news release:
U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jon Tester (D-MT), Jim
Risch (R-ID), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) today introduced the Wildfire Mitigation
Assistance Act to provide resources to assist communities recovering from
damaging wildfires. The bill treats wildfires in the same manner as other
natural disasters by making available Hazard Mitigation Assistance funding to
states affected by catastrophic wildfires.


"Wildfires have catastrophic effects across the West," Bennet said. "We can
dramatically reduce the severity and damage from these wildfires through
mitigation work that minimizes the risk of flooding, erosion, and future fires.
This bill would make it easier for affected communities to receive federal
resources for post-fire recovery and mitigation efforts."
"Throughout the American west, we have felt firsthand the devastation wildfires
have on our habitat, our health and our way of life," Crapo said. "The Wildfire
Mitigation Assistance Act would allow fire-prone communities to apply for Hazard
Mitigation grants through the Federal Emergency Management Agency in order to
undertake 'fire-wise' projects for homes in the wildland urban interface or to
reduce hazardous fuels. Congress must continue to pursue efforts aimed at
reducing the risk and severity of wildfires, as well as improve the response,
prevention and mitigation efforts."
"I have seen firsthand the impact that catastrophic wildfires have on our
communities," Tester said. "Folks impacted by wildfire need assistance long
after the flames stop burning, and this bill will help ensure that folks on the
ground can restore land impacted by fire and better prevent future disasters."

"Massive wildfires destroy homes, businesses, and ecosystems in the west just
like catastrophic hurricanes destroy communities in coastal regions," Risch
said. "This bill will help local governments in Idaho and across the west deal
with the aftermath of large wildfires."
"Wildfires have unfortunately proven once again to be the West's natural
disasters," Wyden said. "This is urgent business that requires an equally urgent
and comprehensive response. This bill marks a key piece of that response to help
people recover from the devastation of wildfires by providing funding to local
governments to reduce flooding and erosion after fires, monitor stream and
habitat health and assist residents in clearing brush from around their homes
and businesses."
Background on the Wildfire Mitigation Assistance Act:
Currently, states can receive hazard mitigation funding to lessen the effects of
a future disaster only after the president declares a major disaster. However,
unlike in the case of hurricanes, floods, or tornados, most wildfires do not
receive a major disaster declaration. This bill will allow states affected by
wildfires to access the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) to implement
measures that reduce the risk of flooding and erosion and take actions to
prevent future wildfires.
Bennet first introduced this measure as part of the PREPARE Act in 2015. Last
week, Bennet, Crapo, Wyden, and Risch attended a briefing with U.S. Agriculture
Secretary Sonny Perdue to press the issue. Last month, Bennet introduced the
Wildfire Disaster Act of 2017 and sent a bipartisan letter urging Senate Leaders
McConnell (R-KY) and Charles Schumer (D-NY) to include a wildfire funding fix in
any future disaster aid legislation.
Statements of support for the legislation:
"Wildfires continue to wreak tremendous damage across our Western landscapes and
communities," said Roy Charles Brooks, President of National Association of
Counties. "They threaten public safety, pollute the air, foul our waters and
disrupt economic and recreational activity. The Wildfire Mitigation Assistance
Act would help focus resources - federal, state and local - to prevent and
recover from wildfires. Counties thank Senators Bennet, Crapo, Risch, Tester and
Wyden for their leadership on this crucial issue."
"I thank Senator Bennet for introducing this important legislation," said Fire
Chief Thomas Jenkins, President and Chairman of the Board of International
Association of Fire Chiefs. "Flooding and landslides can be a serious threat to
communities already suffering from major wildland fire damage. This bill will
help communities prevent further damage from these natural disasters. The IAFC
supports this legislation and urges Congress to pass it."
"While we are frequently judged based on response and criticized based on
recovery, mitigation and preparedness are critical phases of emergency
management and they most often occur outside the spotlight," said Robie
Robinson, former President of the U.S. Council of the International Association
of Emergency Managers. "As mitigation is the linchpin of emergency management,
expanding hazard mitigation grant funding following a Fire Management Assistance
Grant declaration will enable jurisdictions to implement programs that will
effectively reduce risks and return benefits many fold."
"Mitigation projects have been essential to our recovery from 2012's High Park
Fire," said Lew Gaiter III, Larimer County Commissioner. "This legislation will
give communities the resources to reduce the risk of post-fire flooding and
property damage and help support the long-term recovery of communities affected
by wildfires."

New Mexico: Post-wildfire guide now available

LENGTH: 300  words

DATELINE: Santa Fe


City Of Deming has issued the following news release:

SANTA FE >> As wildfires continue to impact the western United States, a new
guide has been developed to help those impacted by wildfire in New Mexico start
on the path to recovery.

New Mexico State Forestry, along with many interagency partners, has created
this guide and a companion website called "After Wildfire: A Guide for New
Mexico Communities," according to New Mexico Forest and Watershed Health Office
Coordinator Susan Rich, who led the project.

"We developed this guide for New Mexicans affected by wildfire and for the
emergency personnel and civic leaders they turn to in a time of crisis," said
Rich. "The initial request for this guide came from people in the trenches,
individuals helping communities hard-hit by wildfire and post-fire flooding. We
wrote it for them."

Funded in part by the USDA Forest Service, the new After Wildfire New Mexico
Guide and website provides information on subjects such as technical guides to
post-wildfire mitigation and land treatments; links to post-wildfire and
flooding funding and financial tips for individuals and communities; how to
mobilize communities and working with volunteer organizations; post-fire and
flooding safety; and resources for emotional support.

"After Wildfire: A Guide for New Mexico Communities" is now available through
the After Wildfire website:www.afterwildfirenm.org.

In addition to the information found in the new guide, the website provides
links to wildfire guides published by other sources as well as links to social
media sites, active wildfire information, contact information to the agencies
who have contributed information to the guide and materials for fire prevention
and preparedness.

New force formed to fight wildfire threat

BYLINE: David Kerr

SECTION: NEWS; 999; Fires; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 556 words


NEW plans to tackle wildfires have been unveiled amid fears the spring could
bring another wave of the devastating outbreaks which have plagued the
Highlands.

A hand-picked squad of officers with specialist knowledge and training will be
created to try to ease the massive strain put on the fire service during long
spells of dry weather over the past few years.

Ironically, the measures are being unveiled as brigade chiefs continue to face a
backlash from the public and politicians over their decision to axe vital
control rooms in Inverness and Aberdeen. Crews tackled about 240 wildfires in
just four weeks in March and April last year.

At one point, firefighters across the Highlands and islands were trying to bring
50 separate blazes under control and helicopters were used in isolated areas to
water-bomb the flames.

Two senior north-based firefighters will now be in charge of efforts to reduce
the number of incidents, which caused hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage
last year.

Garry Burnett will take on a new full-time position dealing with the management
and prevention of wildfires.

The north of Scotland's top firefighter, Assistant Chief Officer Robert Scott,
will be at the helm of the Scottish Wildfire Forum (SWFF), whose members include
landowners.

Mr Scott hopes the tough new approach to the problem will raise awareness,
encourage public responsibility and reduce demand on the service during the
wildfire season.

The announcement of the strategy follows the launch of the UK's first Wildfire
Operational Guidance Manual by the group last year.

Mr Scott said: "In addition to the launch of the guidance manual, we have
committed significant resources to training a number of senior officers to an
advanced level to ensure we have experts available across the country to attend
and control wildfire incidents.

"We have trained over 100 supervisory managers, based in fire stations most
likely to attend these types of incidents, to ensure they do so safely and to
maximum effect."

The new wildfire measures have been announced as the Scottish Fire and Rescue
Service forges ahead with plans to close control rooms in Inverness and Aberdeen
and route 999 calls through Dundee instead.

Newly-appointed Mr Burnett will be based in Aberdeen and will have a specific
brief of dealing with wildfires.

He said: "For me, personally, I am delighted to be returning to the wildfire
environment nearly 10 years after supporting the delivery of the first ever
Scottish Wildfire Forum back in 2005. I am also highly focused to ensure
improved development of our firefighters and incident managers, benefiting
firefighter safety when tackling wildfires."

Community Safety Minister Roseanna Cunningham MSP welcomed the move. "Wildfires
can have a truly devastating impact on communities, agriculture and environment
across the country, and particularly the north of Scotland," she said.

"The Wildfire Operational Guidance has provided fire and rescue services with an
invaluable source of information on how to tackle the behaviour, prevention and
management of wildfire."

Drew McFarlane-Slack, Highland manager for Scottish Land and Estates, said:
"Together we can pool our resources and experience in a bid to reduce the number
of wildfires in Scotland, which have a damaging effect on our environment and
communities."

Software You Can Talk To; Speech-Recognizing, Single-Number Messaging Program Is
Taking Off

Mike Mills, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: FINANCIAL; Pg. F01

LENGTH: 1327 words


Mark Hollander was in a hotel in Bangkok when he gave the concierge at the front
desk a strange request: "A computer, speaking English, will be calling me at 9
a.m.," he said. "Please put the call through to my room."

Sure enough, at the appointed time, a call from the United States came to
Hollander, a District-based advertising producer for the health care industry.

A cheerful but down-to-business female voice named Wildfire gave Hollander his
phone messages. Then Hollander told Wildfire to place several calls to clients
in the states. While he was on the line, she whispered into his ear, asking if
he wanted to take a call that had just come in. As a bonus, Wildfire's handiwork
also helped Hollander to avoid incurring hefty long-distance charges levied by
the Thai hotel.

"My friends give me enormous grief because I have personalized a bunch of
[computer] files," Hollander said, recalling the episode. "But I think of
Wildfire as a person."

Hollander's not alone. Wildfire, a speech recognition-based software program
that juggles a variety of custom calling features, has gained about 250
customers since its debut in the Washington area in April, and is adding new
clients rapidly, according to Joe Gately, president of Linx Communications Inc.
in Alexandria, which offers the service.

Wildfire is the star pupil in an emerging class of "single number" phone
services that take advantage of vastly improved speech-recognition technology.

Think of the computerized "voice-mail lady" you have at work, but with the
cerebral attributes of James Bond's associate Moneypenny: the ability to carry
out a wide range of commands with a smile, an apparent heartfelt concern for the
boss's whereabouts and well-being, and an ability to indulge his or her
sometimes questionable sense of humor.

Say "Wildfire, I'm depressed" and she comes back with "You're depressed? I live
in a box" or "Oh great, now I'm a therapist."

Or: "Wildfire, what does a cow say?"

"MOOOOOOOO."

"I do that every once in a while when I'm stressed," Hollander said.

Wildfire Communications Inc., a privately held company based in Lexington,
Mass., has tapped into people's growing frustration with their thicket of
cordless phones, cellular phones, pagers and customized calling features.

Wildfire condenses everything down to a single phone number that follows you
whether you're at home, in the office or using your cell phone or pager. "As the
world becomes more untethered from any one place, there is a need for something
that anchors their communications," explained Wildfire's chief executive, Robert
Mechaley.

"Being available to my clients is worth a premium to me," Hollander said. "My
clients love not having to call my work, then my home, then my cell phone and
then my pager."

Analysts say Wildfire is the most sophisticated service available to date that
combines speech-recognition with an array of custom-calling features. Tell it
where you'll be, and when, and it will direct calls to you. Call a Wildfire
subscriber often enough and it will remember your voice, greeting you with an,
"Oh, hi" and maybe asking how you're feeling.

The system has worked out lots of bugs over its first few years, but users still
have some gripes: Wildfire can't yet fast-forward or rewind messages, for
example, and users can't "barge in" and speed up commands -- they have to wait
for Wildfire to finish speaking.

Others are catching up, including small software outfits and voice-mail
companies and such phone giants as Lucent Technologies Inc., AT&T Corp. and MCI
Communications Corp.

"You're going to hear more about Wildfire in the future," said Chris Landes, a
telecommunications consultant for TeleChoice Inc. in Verona, N.J. "People are
looking very closely at that particular platform as the most advanced integrated
messaging and call-management service."

Today Wildfire is a pricey service aimed at frequent travelers -- most of whom
seem to be guys. Linx Communications offers Wildfire for $ 39 a month, plus
usage fees that can run monthly bills into the hundreds of dollars. Hollander
says he pays about $ 200 monthly. Customers pay for their own long-distance
calls that Wildfire places.

But Wildfire and other similar services are about to become mass market products
as phone companies begin to put the software directly into their networks.
Pacific Bell Mobile Services in California and BellSouth in Atlanta now offer
stripped-down versions of Wildfire for about $ 10 a month. The network-based
services will sell parts of Wildfire a la carte: Basic packages will offer only
speech-recognition voice mail and dialing, while the follow-you-anywhere single
phone number feature costs more.

Wildfire officials said they are negotiating with Washington area wireless
carriers to provide this area with a similar network-based service. A rival
company, AccessLine Technologies Inc. of Bellevue, Wash., also plans to offer
new speech-recognition-based service through an unnamed Washington area wireless
company.

One recent convert to Wildfire was Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of
the House telecommunications subcommittee. Tauzin plans to have a chat with
Wildfire during a commencement address today at Nicholls State University in his
hometown of Thibodaux, La. The computerized voice will speak in Cajun, using a
salutation loosely translated as, "How ya doin', babe?"

"It's delightful," Tauzin said. World chess champion Garry "Kasparov would have
preferred Wildfire to Deep Blue any day."

Public fascination with speech-recognition technology dates back long before
1968, when Dave Bowman said "Open the pod door, HAL" to his spaceship's
malevolent computer in the film "2001: A Space Odyssey."

Since then, the telecom industry's history with speech recognition has been one
of over-promising and under-delivering. In the past few years, though, the
technology has sped ahead, and the industry has been slow to exploit it.

"The technology has moved forward so fast that the applications development and
the platforms to support it have fallen behind," said William Meisel, editor of
the newsletter Speech Recognition Update in Tarzana, Calif.

The human behind the voice of Wildfire is "a closely guarded trade secret,"
according to Wildfire company spokeswoman Leslie Anderson. "She's a private
person, not a professional actress. She's the ex-girlfriend of one of the
engineers. . . . She just had the right combination of geniality and
helpfulness. She's smart, she's perky."

Meisel predicts software such as Wildfire will do for telephones what Microsoft
Windows did for personal computers.

"If the companies and service providers get it right, this could change the
perception of the telephone with the customer," he said. Just as people change
screen colors on their personal computers, he said, they also may choose
different "personality types" for their computerized personal assistants.

The real Wildfire woman speaks fluent French and Italian, Anderson said. But
those talents may not be fully used: "The Italians aren't sure whether to use a
male or female voice," Anderson said. "Apparently, In Italy it's more
prestigious to have a male assistant."

Fireman's Fund Insurance expands wildfire response program

SECTION: PROPERTY; Business Expansions

LENGTH: 184 words



HIGHLIGHT: In the midst of one of the most active wildfire seasons on record,
Fireman's Fund Insurance Company has expanded its wildfire program to include
response services, which may include the application of fire-blocking solutions
to a policyholder's home and surrounding vegetation.


The Wildfire Response Program, which already included wildfire assessments and
extensive wildfire preparation for homes and land, now provides a complimentary
additional layer of protection to eligible Prestige Home policyholders who
enroll.



"One-third of homes are in Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) making them vulnerable
to wildfire," said Kathleen Stalter, Western Risk Services and Solutions
Manager, Fireman's Fund. "Fireman's Fund is committed to the philosophy of
pre-event preparation making our Wildfire Response Program vital to our
policyholders."

During a wildfire, actions to defend a home from wildfire may include removal of
combustible materials from around the home, set-up of a perimeter sprinkler
system and spray the home or surrounding property with a fire-blocking solution.


The Wildfire Response Program is currently offered in the following states:
Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon,
Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.

In addition to wildfire response services, Fireman's Fund supports the local
Fire Services ongoing wildfire control services

Washington: Bennet, Colleagues Press Senate Leadership to Include Bipartisan
Wildfire Funding Fix in Future Disaster Aid Legislation

LENGTH: 556  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Michael Bennet, U.S Government has issued the
following news release:
With deadly fires still raging across the West, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael
Bennet and a bipartisan group of senators pressed Senate Leaders Mitch McConnell
(R-KY) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) in a letter to include a wildfire funding fix in
future disaster aid legislation in the Senate.


The House of Representatives passed disaster aid legislation last week to
provide funding for hurricanes and wildfires that have hit the country this
year. That bill will allow the U.S. Forest Service to pay back the funds it has
been forced to borrow from other accounts to cover the cost of fighting
wildfires. However, the House-passed legislation does not include a long-term
solution to provide consistent funding for fire suppression and prevention.
Last month, Bennet joined his colleagues to introduce the Wildfire Disaster
Funding Act of 2017. The bipartisan legislation would treat wildfires as natural
disasters and stop the erosion of the Forest Service's budget by reforming the
way the federal government funds wildfires. The legislation also would end "fire
borrowing," which has depleted funds intended for forest restoration, habitat
programs, trail maintenance, and fire prevention. More than 250 private and
public organizations have supported the legislation.
"We request that you work with us to include the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act,
legislative language that ensures the U.S. Forest Service and the Department of
Interior (DOI) have stable, reliable funding to help prevent wildfires," the
senators wrote.
This year, the Forest Service and the Interior Department have spent almost $2.9
billion to put out wildfires. The Forest Service has had to fire borrow from
other accounts to pay for the record-breaking cost of this year's fires.
"Passage of the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act will free up funds to do the
prevention work that reduces the risk of catastrophic wildfires that our country
has suffered this year -- funding that could have prevented the deaths of
Americans, destruction of hundreds of homes and businesses, the loss of business
revenue due to evacuations, and the loss of millions of acres of forests," they
wrote. "We ask that you work with Western senators to include a comprehensive
wildfire funding fix in any disaster supplemental bill that comes before the
Senate."
This is the latest effort by Bennet to improve wildfire prevention, mitigation,
and recovery efforts. Earlier this month, Bennet introduced the Wildfire
Mitigation Assistance Act to provide resources for communities recovering from
damaging wildfires. In September, Bennet met with Secretary of Agriculture Sonny
Perdue and fire experts at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S.
Forest Service for a discussion on record fire season spending and the problem
of fire borrowing.
This is the second letter Bennet has sent to Senate leadership urging them to
include the bipartisan wildfire funding fix in any disaster aid package that
passes through Congress.
In addition to Bennet, the letter's signers include Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR),
Mike Crapo (R-ID), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Dianne Feinstein
(D-CA), Patty Murray (D-WA), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Jon Tester (D-MT), and Jim
Risch (R-ID).

Wildfire awareness remains key prevention device

BYLINE: STAFF REPORT

SECTION: SECTION A; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 462  words


Last week may have been the officially designated Wildfire Awareness Week, but
Flagler County officials remind residents that wildfire awareness is an ongoing
effort.

Residents are urged to become fire wise and be prepared for the potential for
wildfires this spring and early summer, regardless of the wetter than normal
past winter season.

Due to the recent El Nio phenomenon, Florida experienced wetter than normal
winter months, which will help to diminish the threat of a severe wildfire
season," said David Halstead, interim director of the Florida Division of
Emergency Management.

Flagler County Fire/Rescue Chief Don Petito advises residents to take added
caution during the fire season through the spring months.

Be careful when cooking outdoors, refrain from open burning of leaves and other
debris and be particularly careful on windy days when fire can spread quickly,"
he said

Florida is a wildfire-prone state, with much of the native ecosystems dependent
on natural wildfires. In Florida some vegetation, even though it is green, will
readily burn. Therefore, residents should take the necessary precautions as we
near the height of wildfire season." Petito said.

County fire officials offered the follow facts on wildfires in Florida:*March,
April, May and June are the most active months of Florida's wildfire
season.*1998 was the most devastating wildfire season in Florida's recent
history with 500,000 acres burned in nearly 2,300 separate wildfires. The season
represented a 1,700 percent increase from Florida's typical five-year average
and costs to federal, state, and local governments were estimated at more than
$160 million.*From January through October of 2009, more than 2,800 wildfires
across Florida burned more than 136,000 acres of state and federal lands. Though
this may seem like a lot of fires, 2009 was a fairly inactive wildfire season
compared to recent years.

Since January 1, 852 wildfires have burned on 13,407 acres in Florida. Most of
these fires were caused by human carelessness.

To protect property from wildfires, residents are encouraged to:*Create a
"defensible space" clear of brush 30 feet around your home.*Prune tree limbs to
a height of 15 feet near structures.*Thin out trees and shrubs so there is 10 to
15 feet between the tree crowns.*Keep your roof and gutters free of leaves and
pine needles.*Replace highly flammable landscape material with plant materials
with higher water content.*Check lawnmowers and farm equipment for properly
working spark arresters.*Properly extinguish fires when cooking outdoors and
never leave fires unattended.*Insure your home's street address is clearly
marked for firefighters.*Review and practice your fire escape plan.

Critical wildfire danger predicted for much of Texas

BYLINE: Palestine Herald-Press, Texas

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 300 words


Feb. 20--COLLEGE STATION  -- The Texas Forest Service is warning citizens across
the state of heightened wildfire danger due to gusty winds, low relative
humidity values and critically dry vegetation today.

The area of concern is the I-35 corridor and west.

"The critical wildfire weather and critically dry fuels present a serious
concern to this area of the state," said Tom Spencer, predictive services
department head for TFS. "These conditions could easily lead to significant
wildfire occurrences."

Spencer said that a significant wildfire is one that can exceed the control of
local resources and pose a serious threat to citizens and property.

In Texas, people start 95 percent of wildfires. Citizens need to be aware of the
conditions and should not engage in activities, such as throwing out lit
cigarettes, bailing hay, welding and burning debris, that could lead to an
accidental wildfire start.

Since the beginning of the winter 2009 wildfire season, which began on January
22, TFS has responded along with local fire departments to 186 wildfires for
30,009 acres. During the same period, local fire departments have reported an
additional 1,255 wildfires for 25,191 acres, according to an online database
managed by TFS.

Fire departments to address wildfires

BYLINE: Matt Naber, Bigfork Eagle, Mont.

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 564 words


March 14--The Bigfork and Ferndale Fire Departments will each an host open house
that addresses concerns about wildfire risks, prevention, and options for safe
debris burning. Bigfork's open house will be March 14 at 7 p.m., Ferndale's will
be March 22 at 7 p.m.

Each open house is called "Firewise," meaning being aware of wildfire risks and
performing taks to minimize their impact.

In 2005, the greater Bigfork area was designated a national "Firewise Community"
after National Fire Plan grant funding was used to provide a wildfire risk
informational program and incentives for many area homeowners to reduce their
wildfire risk.

The program is designed to encourage local solutions for wildfire risk reduction
in areas that are prone to fire. Bigfork, Ferndale, and Swan Lake Fire districts
currently have grant funding available for qualifying private landowners
adjacent to Federal lands, to reduce their wildfire risk.

The programs at the Bigfork Fire Department and Ferndale Fire Department will
consist of a 45-minute presentation on area wildfire history, fire ecology,
potential fire behavior and case studies of fires involving structure loss.

Participants will learn about area wildfire potential, their specific wildfire
risks, options for minimizing risks, and the landowner cost-share grant program
near federal lands.

A question and answer session will follow the presentation with a focus on
options for safe debris burning as well as any public concerns brought to the
forum.

The open house is an annual event in the past that started in 2000 after a
series of destructive wildfires in northwestern Montana brought home protection
and wildfire prevention to the forefront.

"We didn't do it last year and felt this was a good time to do it," Rick
Trembath, retired Bigfork Fire Department Chief said. Trembath is also the
administrator of the National Fire Plan Fuel Reduction grant.

Wildfire fuels, various combinations of "woody mass," are a little dryer this
year due to the lower precipitation rates so far. Residents with wooded area to
the west of their homes should be particularly "fire wise" because according to
Trembath wild fires in the Bigfork and Ferndale area tend to move from west to
east.

"If you got a lot of forest and fuel to the west of you, those folks should feel
more uncomfortable," Trembath said. "It's really a universal situation for all
of us living where there's forest around us."

In a press release, Trembath listed the following facts about forest fires:

--Most homes burn down from spark ignition, rather than from direct flame
ignition.

--Evacuations are even more dangerous than staying at a home under certain
conditions.

--Firefighters will pick and choose which homes to stay at based on fire
behavior.

--The fire intensity is directly related to fuel conditions, topography, and the
weather.

--Reducing forest fuel loading is the only means of mitigating forest fire
intensity.

--Our past success suppressing forest fire, may in fact be leading to future
intense fires.

--A home and outbuilding "alignment" can be critical in forest fire
vulnerability.

For more information about the "Firewise" open house, call the Bigfork Fire
Department at 837-4590 or Trembath at 261-7519.

Capstone Reports More High Grade Copper-Gold Intercepts in Wildfire Discovery,
Minto Mine

LENGTH: 650  words

DATELINE: Karachi


Karachi, Aug. 19 -- Capstone Mining Corp. (CS: TSX) today announced assay
results for three new holes from Wildfire, the most recent high grade
copper-gold discovery at its Minto Mine. Follow-up drilling continues with two
drills on Wildfire and the 2010 exploration budget has been increased by a
further $1.5 million to allow systematic drill testing of this prospective
discovery and other targets generated from a deep penetrating IP survey
completed in 2010. Highlights from the most recent holes drilled at Wildfire are
summarized in the table below.

"The high grade Wildfire copper-gold discovery at Minto continues to spread,"
said Stephen Quin, President of Capstone. "With an additional $1.5 million in
exploration funds, we are positioned to systematically drill test the entire
anomaly, as well as begin the evaluation of a number of other prospective
targets identified during the recent geophysical survey," he added.

Wildfire Discovery - Minto Mine

As reported on July 15, 2010, Capstone commenced construction of a network of
drill roads over the Wildfire-Copper Keel area in order to facilitate the
evaluation of the Wildfire Titan-24 chargeability anomaly that measures more
than 900 metres north-south by more than 250 metres east-west. With drill roads
now established, two drills are systematically drilling on four east-west
orientated sections across the Wildfire-Copper Keel chargeability anomaly, with
each section line spaced approximately 80 metres apart (north-south). The
objective of this program is (a) establish the geographic extent of the Wildfire
mineralization and (b) to attempt to link the Wildfire mineralization to that at
Copper Keel, to the northwest. To date 23 holes have been completed and,
including this news release, results released for four holes. The third drill
continues delineation drilling at Minto East, but is expected to complete this
work within two weeks, and will then move on to testing other targets.

Additional Minto Drilling

Also, as reported on June 23, 2010, Capstone undertook a property-wide Titan-24
deep penetrating Induced Potential ("IP") survey. Due to the discovery of, and
the subsequent expanded testing at Wildfire, funds that were intended to drill
test these other Titan-24 anomalies were diverted to evaluating the Wildfire
discovery. In order to ensure that Capstone can still drill test several other
new and untested anomalies identified in the survey, an additional $1.5 million
dollars in exploration spending has been approved, the second increase this
year. This brings the total exploration commitment to $7.0 million, the highest
annual exploration commitment for the Minto Mine and a reflection of the
Company's belief that significant opportunities exist for continued increases of

than 900 metres north-south by more than 250 metres east-west. With drill roads
now established, two drills are systematically drilling on four east-west
orientated sections across the Wildfire-Copper Keel chargeability anomaly, with
each section line spaced approximately 80 metres apart (north-south). The
objective of this program is (a) establish the geographic extent of the Wildfire
mineralization and (b) to attempt to link the Wildfire mineralization to that at
Copper Keel, to the northwest. To date 23 holes have been completed and,
including this news release, results released for four holes. The third drill
continues delineation drilling at Minto East, but is expected to complete this
work within two weeks, and will then move on to testing other targets.

Additional Minto Drilling

Also, as reported on June 23, 2010, Capstone undertook a property-wide Titan-24
deep penetrating Induced Potential ("IP") survey. Due to the discovery of, and
the subsequent expanded testing at Wildfire, funds that were intended to drill
test these other Titan-24 anomalies were diverted to evaluating the Wildfire
discovery. In order to ensure that Capstone can still drill test several other
new and untested anomalies identified in the survey, an additional $1.5 million
dollars in exploration spending has been approved, the second increase this
year. This brings the total exploration commitment to $7.0 million, the highest
annual exploration commitment for the Minto Mine and a reflection of the
Company's belief that significant opportunities exist for continued increases of
mineral resources and mineral reserves Published by HT Syndication with

Washington: Risch, Crapo, Western Senators Introduce Bill to Improve Fire
Recovery and Mitigation Efforts

LENGTH: 907  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Jim Risch has issued the following news
release:

U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jon Tester (D-MT), Jim
Risch (R-ID), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) today introduced the Wildfire Mitigation
Assistance Act to provide resources to assist communities recovering from
damaging wildfires. The bill treats wildfires in the same manner as other
natural disasters by making available Hazard Mitigation Assistance funding to
states affected by catastrophic wildfires.


"Wildfires have catastrophic effects across the West," Bennet said. "We can
dramatically reduce the severity and damage from these wildfires through
mitigation work that minimizes the risk of flooding, erosion, and future fires.
This bill would make it easier for affected communities to receive federal
resources for post-fire recovery and mitigation efforts."
"Throughout the American west, we have felt firsthand the devastation wildfires
have on our habitat, our health and our way of life," Crapo said.  "The Wildfire
Mitigation Assistance Act would allow fire-prone communities to apply for Hazard
Mitigation grants through the Federal Emergency Management Agency in order to
undertake 'fire-wise' projects for homes in the wildland urban interface or to
reduce hazardous fuels.  Congress must continue to pursue efforts aimed at
reducing the risk and severity of wildfires, as well as improve the response,
prevention and mitigation efforts."
"I have seen firsthand the impact that catastrophic wildfires have on our
communities," Tester said. "Folks impacted by wildfire need assistance long
after the flames stop burning, and this bill will help ensure that folks on the
ground can restore land impacted by fire and better prevent future disasters."

"Massive wildfires destroy homes, businesses, and ecosystems in the west just
like catastrophic hurricanes destroy communities in coastal regions," said
Risch. "This bill will help local governments in Idaho and across the west deal
with the aftermath of large wildfires."
"Wildfires have unfortunately proven once again to be the West's natural
disasters," Wyden said. "This is urgent business that requires an equally urgent
and comprehensive response. This bill marks a key piece of that response to help
people recover from the devastation of wildfires by providing funding to local
governments to reduce flooding and erosion after fires, monitor stream and
habitat health and assist residents in clearing brush from around their homes
and businesses."
Background on the Wildfire Mitigation Assistance Act:
Currently, states can receive hazard mitigation funding to lessen the effects of
a future disaster only after the president declares a major disaster. However,
unlike in the case of hurricanes, floods, or tornados, most wildfires do not
receive a major disaster declaration. This bill will allow states affected by
wildfires to access the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) to implement
measures that reduce the risk of flooding and erosion and take actions to
prevent future wildfires.
Bennet first introduced this measure as part of the PREPARE Act in 2015. Last
week, Bennet, Crapo, Wyden, and Risch attended a briefing with U.S. Agriculture
Secretary Sonny Perdue to press the issue. Last month, Bennet introduced the
Wildfire Disaster Act of 2017 and sent a bipartisan letter urging Senate Leaders
McConnell (R-KY) and Charles Schumer (D-NY) to include a wildfire funding fix in
any future disaster aid legislation.
Statements of support for the legislation:
"Wildfires continue to wreak tremendous damage across our Western landscapes and
communities," said Roy Charles Brooks, President of National Association of
Counties. "They threaten public safety, pollute the air, foul our waters and
disrupt economic and recreational activity. The Wildfire Mitigation Assistance
Act would help focus resources - federal, state and local - to prevent and
recover from wildfires. Counties thank Senators Bennet, Crapo, Risch, Tester and
Wyden for their leadership on this crucial issue."
"I thank Senator Bennet for introducing this important legislation," said Fire
Chief Thomas Jenkins, President and Chairman of the Board of International
Association of Fire Chiefs. "Flooding and landslides can be a serious threat to
communities already suffering from major wildland fire damage. This bill will
help communities prevent further damage from these natural disasters. The IAFC
supports this legislation and urges Congress to pass it."
"While we are frequently judged based on response and criticized based on
recovery, mitigation and preparedness are critical phases of emergency
management and they most often occur outside the spotlight," said Robie
Robinson, former President of the U.S. Council of the International Association
of Emergency Managers. "As mitigation is the linchpin of emergency management,
expanding hazard mitigation grant funding following a Fire Management Assistance
Grant declaration will enable jurisdictions to implement programs that will
effectively reduce risks and return benefits many fold."
"Mitigation projects have been essential to our recovery from 2012's High Park
Fire," said Lew Gaiter III, Larimer County Commissioner. "This legislation will
give communities the resources to reduce the risk of post-fire flooding and
property damage and help support the long-term recovery of communities affected
by wildfires."

Florida: Commissioner Putnam Recognizes National Fire Prevention Week

LENGTH: 461  words




 Tallahassee:  Department of Agricuture And Consumer Service, The State of
Florida has issued the following news release:







 In case of any query regarding this article or other content please contact:

editorial@plusmediasolutions.com
 Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam H. Putnam and the Florida Forest
Service are highlighting the dangers associated with wildfire and encourage
Floridians to make wildfire preparedness a priority during National Fire
Prevention Week, October 9-15.



  "Florida is no stranger to natural disaster, with many Floridians currently
recovering from Hurricane Matthew," stated Commissioner Adam H. Putnam. "I
encourage citizens to incorporate wildfire preparedness into their disaster
plans - and to remain prepared throughout the year.



 Unlike hurricanes, wildfires in Florida can start without warning and spread
rapidly, leaving little to no time to prepare. Several measures that Floridians
have already taken to prepare for hurricanes, such as creating a " go kit" and
evacuation plan, are useful in case of wildfire. Wildfire danger levels will
likely increase throughout Florida after hurricane season concludes. For this
reason, the Florida Forest Service is encouraging residents to prepare now and
make their homes wildfire resistant.



 "As communities clean up from Hurricane Matthew, we encourage them to take
stock of their area to assess wildfire risk and make any necessary changes,"
said Jim Karels, Florida State Forester. "Reducing wildfire risk can be as
simple as removing excess dry debris or flammable plants on and around homes."



 Residents can conduct their own wildfire risk assessment [ Adobe PDF Document
150.14 KB ] or contact a local wildfire mitigation specialist for assistance
assessing, managing and reducing wildfire risk. Some easy wildfire safety tips
include:



     Keep dead, dry debris and flammable plants away from the home, fence and
deck;

     Keep roof and gutters free of dry debris;

     Keep flammable materials like gasoline and firewood away from the home; and


     Remove dead vegetation and debris from under the deck and within 10 feet of
the home.



 Since January 1, more than 2,000 wildfires have burned nearly 70,000 acres
throughout Florida. Report all wildfires immediately by calling 911 or a local
Florida Forest Service field unit office.



 The Florida Forest Service, a division of the Florida Department of Agriculture
and Consumer Services, manages more than 1 million acres of state forests and
provides forest management assistance on more than 17 million acres of private
and community forests. The Florida Forest Service is also responsible for
protecting homes, forestland and natural resources from the devastating effects
of wildfire on more than 26 million acres.

Marin firefighters battle wildfires across California

BYLINE: By Nels Johnson Marin Independent Journal

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 205 words


Nearly three dozen Marin firefighters have been dispatched to help battle
wildfires raging across California.

Teams of firefighters from several departments are on duty at both ends of the
state, and more are ready to go if needed.

Deputy County Fire Chief Mark Brown said the latest tally indicates 32 Marin
firefighters are on duty at various fire locales, but noted plenty of
firefighters remain on duty in Marin.

"This in no way jeopardizes the coverage we give to Marin," Brown said.

The county department has sent 11 regular staffers and 10 seasonal firefighters
along with five engines, Brown said. The Larkspur, Corte Madera, Novato and
Southern Marin departments sent a total of 10 firefighters, and San Rafael sent
Battalion Chief Jeff Buscher.

In Southern California, thousands of people evacuated as a wind-whipped wildfire
dubbed "Silver" destroyed more than two dozen homes when it swept over 14,000
acres. The inferno was headed toward Palm Springs Friday.

Other wildfires are burning in Riverside County; northwest of San Bernardino;
the Sierra National Forest; the Stanislaus National Forest, and in Klamath
National Forest.

Washington: Wyden Pushes Trump Administration to Support Wildfire Funding Fix in
Disaster Aid for Hurricane Harvey

LENGTH: 380  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Ron Wyden has issued the following news
release:

After the governors of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana and California
declared states of emergency from wildfires ripping across the West, Sen. Ron
Wyden, D-Ore., today pushed the Trump administration to include wildfire funding
fix in any request to Congress for disaster aid.


Wyden has repeatedly pushed Congress to pass a wildfire fix and reform the way
the federal government fights wildfires. Wyden and Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho,
first introduced in 2013 the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act. A similar wildfire
funding fix was included in July in legislation under consideration by the
Senate Banking Committee to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program.
Both approaches would end the cycle of underfunding fire suppression that
currently forces federal agencies to steal from fire prevention to fight fires.
They would also end "fire borrowing" by funding the largest wildfires from a
similar disaster account used to fund other natural disasters.
"Right now hundreds of thousands of acres are burning across Washington, Oregon,
California, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Nevada, and Utah. More than 7.65 million
acres of forests have burned this year alone," Wyden wrote in a letter to Trump.

"As the long recovery begins in Houston and the surrounding areas, I ask that
you also include a wildfire funding fix in any disaster aid request you send to
Congress," Wyden wrote."It is long past time to address the ongoing, devastating
natural disaster of wildfires raging across western states."
In an August letter to the leaders of the Senate Banking Committee, Wyden, along
with Sens. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Martin Heinrich,
D-N.M., urged the Senate to work to pass a wildfire funding fix similar to the
Wildfire Disaster Funding Act in legislation under consideration by the Senate
Banking Committee to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program.
According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the risk of flooding after
wildfires is"significantly higher" for up to five years after a wildfire.
Wildfires increase the risk of floods and flash flooding by wiping out trees,
shrubs and other plants that allow soil to absorb rainfall and snowmelt.

As Wildfires Continue to Ravage California, Save the Children Offers Tips to
Parents & Communities to Help Keep Kids Safe

LENGTH: 479  words



California: The Department of Children Federation Organization has issued the
following news release:
Since October 8, more than 217,000 acres of land have burned in California as a
result of more than two dozen wildfires across the state. Save the Children has
been monitoring the California wildfires since they started last week.


Here are ten tips Save the Children recommends for parents, teachers,
grandparents and caregivers to help children cope with the news of the
California wildfires:
PREPARE
1. Listen to and answer your children's questions about the wildfires. Spend
time with your family discussing why wildfires occur. Explain how to prevent
them and what to do if one occurs. Explain that a wildfire can be a natural
event and not anyone's fault. Use simple words that even young children can
understand.
2. Know your risk. Learn about your area's risk of wildfires, particularly if
you live near forests, in rural areas, or in a dry climate. Contact your local
fire department, state forestry office, or other emergency response agencies for
information on fire laws and wildfire risk.
3. Learn caregivers' disaster plans. If your child's school or childcare center
is in an area at risk from wildfires, find out what its plans are for in case of
a wildfire. Ask about its evacuation plans are and if you would be required to
pick up your child from the site or from another location.
4. Practice evacuation drills. Practice your family evacuation plan so that, if
told to do so, you can evacuate quickly and safely. Plan and practice two ways
out of your neighborhood as one route may be blocked.
DURING A WILDFIRE
5. Stay informed. If a wildfire is approaching, listen regularly to local radio
or television stations for updated emergency information. Follow the
instructions of local officials as they will know safest evacuation route.
6. Have supplies ready. If you must evacuate, wear protective clothing such as
sturdy shoes, cotton or wool long pants and long-sleeved shirts and gloves. Lock
your home and take your disaster supplies kit with you.
7. Avoid smoke and fumes. Keep children, babies and infants away from areas
where there is smoke or fumes, and stay indoors if possible. Smoke produced by
the wildfire may cause breathing problems or contain poisonous toxins.
AFTER A WILDFIRE
8. Use caution when returning to a burned area. Get permission from fire
officials before returning to a burned wildfire area. Look out for hazards such
as fallen wires and ash pits and be alert as fire re-ignition may be possible.

9. Clean up safely. Follow public health guidance on safe cleanup of fire ash
and safe use of masks. Keep children away from burned sites until cleanup is
complete.
10. Limit media exposure. Protect children from seeing too many images of the
wildfire, including those on the internet, television or newspapers.

Idaho: Boise Fire hosts free seminar to teach homeowners how to protect property
against wildfires

LENGTH: 335  words

DATELINE: Boise


City of Boise Idaho, has issued the following news release:

We know that we can't change the path of a tornado, but we can change the path
of a wildfire. Our homes and communities can survive severe wildfires! When
buildings and landscapes are designed and maintained properly, they have a
better chance of withstanding a wildfire by themselves without assistance from
fire fighters. In fact, managing landscapes around homes and communities can
actually improve plant health, keep them compatible with natural ecosystems and
allow them to survive dangerous wildfires.

Assessing Residential Wildfire Hazards is a free one-day seminar that will
provide the following:

A thorough overview of how homes ignite from wildfire
    An introduction to the home ignition zone concept
    Firewise® principles
    Actions residents can take to harden homes from wildfire igni­tions

This seminar is a great introductory course for agencies, community
stakeholders, insurance professionals and anyone interested in learning about
wildfire hazards and the actions they can implement to reduce potential wildfire
losses.

Learning and applying Firewise® principles empowers residents and communities,
in all regions of the United States, to improve local and wildland landscapes,
provide a safe environment for first responders and protect our homes and
communities from severe wildfires. Assess­ing Residential Wildfire Hazards

Province quadruples funding for wildfire protection to $15 million

BYLINE: Stuart Thomson, Edmonton Journal

SECTION: CITY &; REGION; Pg. A2

LENGTH: 341 words


As the province gears up for another wildfire season, Agriculture Minister Oneil
Carlier announced a big boost Thursday to funding that helps Alberta communities
protect themselves against wildfires.

The province will provide $15 million a year for the FireSmart program, up from
$3.8 million last year. The government is making a three-year commitment of $45
million, which includes $10.5 million specifically for the Fort McMurray area,
which is still recovering from last year's massive wildfire.

The fire destroyed homes, dragged the economy down and caused emotional trauma
in firefighters and residents.

FireSmart is a Canada-wide program that helps communities reduce the risk of
wildfire and plan for the worst-case scenario. The funds will go to wildfire
education, vegetation management and emergency planning, among other things.

The program is just "one tool in the tool box," Carlier stated in a news
release.

"The past few years have shown us that we need to do everything we can to help
reduce the risk of wildfire," he said.

With 70 per cent of the wildfires in the province started by human activity,
prevention is a major focus of the government's wildfire strategy. The Fort
McMurray fire is still fresh in people's minds and Carlier said in an interview
Monday he hopes it will encourage people to be more careful this year.

Carlier made the announcement at the Alberta Agriculture and Forestry wildfire
warehouse and air tanker base at Fort McMurray International Airport, before
embarking on a tour of the facility.

The province has moved the official start of the wildfire season forward to
March 1, to allow fire crews to start getting equipment ready, do last-minute
recruiting and prepare the airbases and towers. Firefighters were battling
wildfires as early as mid-April last year, but wildfire prevention officials are
hopeful that wet weather in most of the province will make for a different
spring this year. sxthomson@postmedia.com twitter.com/stuartxthomson

Parts of Texas under critical wildfire danger

BYLINE: Palestine Herald-Press, Texas

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 318 words


Feb. 28--COLLEGE STATION -- Texas Forest Service (TFS) is warning citizens
across North, Central and South Texas of heightened wildfire danger due to
strong winds, low relative humidity values and critically dry vegetation on
Saturday.

The areas of concern are north and west of the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex,
North Texas, Central Texas, the Hill Country and South Texas."

Tom Spencer, predictive services department head with TFS, said today's
predicted critical weather conditions greatly increase wildfire danger in this
area."

"Vegetation across Texas is very dry and susceptible to accidental wildfire
starts because of the persistent dry weather pattern and entrenched drought,"
Spencer said. "These wildfires, if accidentally started, represent a serious
threat to citizens and their property."

In Texas, people cause 95 percent of wildfires. Citizens should not engage in
activities, such as throwing out lit cigarettes, welding and burning debris,
that could lead to an accidental wildfire start."

Since the beginning of the winter 2009 wildfire season, which began on January
22, 2009, TFS has responded along with local fire departments to 262 wildfires
for 42,045 acres. During the same period, local fire departments have reported
an additional 1,670 wildfires for 30,783 acres according to an online database
managed by TFS."

Washington: Capps Continues to Push for Designated Federal Funding to Combat
Wildfires

LENGTH: 360  words




 Washington: Office of the MP Lois Capps has issued the following news release:



 Today, Rep. Lois Capps (CA-24) reiterated her support for H.R. 167, the
Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, bipartisan legislation that would ensure
wildfires are funded similarly to natural disasters and end the harmful practice
known as "fire borrowing." Currently, when the cost of fighting wildfires
exceeds the U.S. Forest Service's firefighting budget, the agency is forced to
borrow funds previously allocated for forest management initiatives that would
help reduce the impact of future wildfires. The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act
would make the commonsense change to treat the federal wildfire suppression
budget like other major disasters, such as floods and hurricanes, instead of
using funds allocated for fire prevention for fire response. Capps joins 147
Members of Congress as a cosponsor of the bill.





 Capps released the following statement regarding the need to fund wildfire
suppression:



 "We owe our deepest gratitude to our firefighters and first responders who
continue to put their lives on the line in treacherous conditions to keep our
communities safe, and we must ensure they have the resources they need to do
their jobs safely and effectively," Capps said. "As our communities have
recently seen thousands of acres burn during the Sherpa Fire and Pine Fire, we
on the Central Coast are far too familiar with the increasing threat of
wildfires -- and what it takes to combat them. With fire season just underway,
Congress must act immediately to responsibly fund our nation's wildfire
suppression efforts without diverting important prevention resources. The
Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would provide designated funding to combat
wildfires, treating them like other natural disasters while protecting the
Forest Service's budget in the process. With wildfires occurring more frequently
due to drought conditions, funding must be readily available to these agencies
so that they are best prepared to respond quickly and protect the public."

Wildfire threat tackled by new squad

BYLINE: David Kerr

SECTION: NEWS; 999; Fires; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 453 words


New plans to tackle wildfires have been unveiled amid fears the spring could
bring another wave of the devastating outbreaks which have plagued the
Highlands.

A hand-picked squad of officers with specialist knowledge and training will be
created to try to ease the massive strain put on the fire service during long
spells of dry weather over the past few years.

Crews tackled about 240 wildfires in just four weeks in March and April last
year. At one point, firefighters across the Highlands and islands were trying to
bring 50 separate blazes under control and helicopters were used in isolated
areas to water bomb the flames.

Two senior north-based firefighters will now be in charge of efforts to reduce
the number of incidents, which caused hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage
last year.

Garry Burnett will take on a new full-time position dealing with the management
and prevention of wildfires.

The north of Scotland's top firefighter, assistant chief officer Robert Scott,
will be at the helm of the Scottish Wildfire Forum (SWFF), whose members include
landowners.

Mr Scott hopes the tough new approach to the problem will raise awareness,
encourage public responsibility and reduce demand on the service during the
wildfire season.

The announcement of the strategy follows the launch of the UK's first Wildfire
Operational Guidance Manual by the group last year.

Mr Scott said: "In addition to the launch of the guidance manual we have
committed significant resources to training a number of senior officers to an
advanced level to ensure we have experts available across the country to attend
and control wildfire incidents.

"We have trained over 100 supervisory managers, based in fire stations most
likely to attend these types of incidents, to ensure they do so safely and to
maximum effect."

The new wildfire measures have been announced as the Scottish Fire and Rescue
Service forges ahead with plans to close control rooms in Inverness and Aberdeen
and route 999 calls through Dundee instead.

Newly-appointed Mr Burnett will be based in Aberdeen and have a specific brief
on wildfires.

He said: "For me, personally, I am delighted to be returning to the wildfire
environment nearly 10 years after supporting the delivery of the first ever
Scottish Wildfire Forum back in 2005."

Community Safety Minister Roseanna Cunningham MSP welcomed the move.

"Wildfires can have a truly devastating impact on communities, agriculture and
environment across the country, and particularly the north of Scotland," she
said.

"The Wildfire Operational Guidance has provided fire and rescue services with an
invaluable source of information on how to tackle the behaviour, prevention and
management of wildfire."

Fire Funding Boost; FireSmart program helps communities protect against

NIEA hosts international wildfire investigation seminar

LENGTH: 1073 words




 London: Northern Ireland has issued the following news release:



  A two-day international wildfire investigation seminar 'Wildfires, Don't
Speculate, Investigate!', took place earlier this week in Newry.The first to be
held on the island of Ireland, the seminar was organised to help fire protection
professionals better understand wildfires in order to improve prevention
measures and develop their investigative skills.





 Accurately determining the origin of a wild land fire and its cause is an
essential first step in a successful fire investigation. Proper investigative
procedures during a fire's initial stages can more accurately pinpoint its cause
and preserve valuable evidence that might be destroyed by fire-fighting
activities.



 If a wild fire is caused by human action, the recommended protective measures
can preserve evidence that may lead to effective and fair administrative, civil,
or criminal actions.



 Speaking from the seminar, Colum McDaid who leads on wildfire control
initiatives in the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) said: "The impact
of uncontrolled wildfires on habitats in Northern Ireland is of significant
concern. Given the large scale damage that uncontrolled wildfires can cause, it
is essential to raise awareness of the issue and provide practical guidance to
both control and prevent uncontrolled wildfires.



 "Wildfires are uniquely challenging in terms of prevention, suppression and
investigation. By identifying the causes of wildfires fire protection
professionals can design better safeguards to prevent others, which will help
reduce the loss of property and habitat in the long term.



 "The vigorous and thorough investigation of wildfires is the key to catching
arsonists and can be critical in identifying serial arsonists before they might
move on to bigger targets.



 "The law states that burning of vegetation such as heather, gorse, whin or fern
must not be carried out between 15 April and 31 August, and only carried out at
other times of the year under controlled and expert supervision. In addition, it
should be noted that any burning within a designated site such as an Area of
Special Scientific Interest may need consent from DAERA.



 "As the seasons grow warmer and the evenings longer, more of us will be
venturing outdoors so I'd urge everyone to heed our advice to help protect
themselves and our environment from wildfires."



 Alex Held of Working on Fire International said: "Fire investigation training,
in my experience, is an excellent toolkit for fire management in general.
Understanding fire behaviour, its influencing factors and the related effects in
the landscape are of immense value.



 "Fire Investigation can be used to increase our fire understanding, to
determine cause and origin, serve in court cases, deter arsonists and help to
target prevention campaigns better. In general, understanding the indicators of
a fire and reading its history makes you a better fire manager, leading to
better decision making."



 Such is the importance of the issue of wildfire that this seminar is being
followed up by a knowledge exchange visit by two wildfire officers from the
Dutch Fire and Rescue Service next week. During their visit they will see at
first hand the work being undertaken to reduce the incidence of wildfires. They
will share their knowledge and expertise with the NIEA, Northern Ireland Fire
and Rescue Service, the Department of Agriculture Food and Marine (RoI) and the
National Parks and Wildlife Service (RoI).



 Mark Smyth, Group Commander and NIFRS Lead Officer for Wildfires added: "During
2015/16 we attended 1,439 gorse fires and already this year we have dealt with
the first gorse fires of the season. While the overall number of gorse fires has
reduced in the last three years, it remains a significant community problem.



 "We know that the majority of gorse fires we attend are started deliberately
but given the nature of these fires and their rapid fire spread, identifying the
exact origin and cause of the fire can be difficult. Learning from the
experience of Fire Investigators from other countries and sharing our own
experiences and techniques has been invaluable.



 "Alongside partner agencies and community groups, we have been working hard to
address the problem of gorse fires and educate people about the dangers and
consequences of deliberate fire setting both to themselves, their community and
on NIFRS.  We will continue to work in partnership tackle this issue and to
further reduce gorse fires happening in Northern Ireland."



 The messages about the impacts of wildfires and how to avoid them are clear and
simple:



     Wildfires are not natural - they are almost always started by humans either
deliberately or by being careless;

     Wildfires put lives at risk - they could result in tragedy for people
caught in the line of fire. Dealing with these types of incidents puts not only
firefighters' lives at risk but the lives of everyone in the local community.
Firefighters are diverted from other emergencies and contingency plans have to
be put in place to ensure continued emergency cover for towns and villages
across Northern Ireland - this may result in a slight delay when responding;

     Wildfires cost everyone - the whole community, as well as businesses that
provide much needed employment. Between 2005 and 2010 £35 million was spent on
fighting wildfires alone;

     Wildfires destroy our surroundings - how they look and the wildlife in
them;

     Wildfires are illegal - deliberate setting of wildfires is a criminal
offence.



 If you are in the countryside:



     Extinguish cigarettes and other smoking materials properly;

     Never throw cigarette ends out of car windows;

     Only use barbecues in designated areas and never leave them unattended;

     Ensure that barbecues are fully extinguished and cold before disposing of
their contents;

     Avoid using open fires in the countryside;

     Do not leave bottles or glass behind - sunlight shining through glass can
start a fire.



 If you see a fire:



     If you see a fire in the countryside, report it immediately to the Fire &
Rescue Service;

     Do not attempt to tackle fires that cannot be put out with a bucket of
water;

     Leave the area as soon as possible;

     If you see someone setting fires, report it to the PSNI.

NIEA hosts international wildfire investigation seminar

LENGTH: 1073 words




 London: Northern Ireland has issued the following news release:



  A two-day international wildfire investigation seminar 'Wildfires, Don't
Speculate, Investigate!', took place earlier this week in Newry.The first to be
held on the island of Ireland, the seminar was organised to help fire protection
professionals better understand wildfires in order to improve prevention
measures and develop their investigative skills.





 Accurately determining the origin of a wild land fire and its cause is an
essential first step in a successful fire investigation. Proper investigative
procedures during a fire's initial stages can more accurately pinpoint its cause
and preserve valuable evidence that might be destroyed by fire-fighting
activities.



 If a wild fire is caused by human action, the recommended protective measures
can preserve evidence that may lead to effective and fair administrative, civil,
or criminal actions.



 Speaking from the seminar, Colum McDaid who leads on wildfire control
initiatives in the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) said: "The impact
of uncontrolled wildfires on habitats in Northern Ireland is of significant
concern. Given the large scale damage that uncontrolled wildfires can cause, it
is essential to raise awareness of the issue and provide practical guidance to
both control and prevent uncontrolled wildfires.



 "Wildfires are uniquely challenging in terms of prevention, suppression and
investigation. By identifying the causes of wildfires fire protection
professionals can design better safeguards to prevent others, which will help
reduce the loss of property and habitat in the long term.



 "The vigorous and thorough investigation of wildfires is the key to catching
arsonists and can be critical in identifying serial arsonists before they might
move on to bigger targets.



 "The law states that burning of vegetation such as heather, gorse, whin or fern
must not be carried out between 15 April and 31 August, and only carried out at
other times of the year under controlled and expert supervision. In addition, it
should be noted that any burning within a designated site such as an Area of
Special Scientific Interest may need consent from DAERA.



 "As the seasons grow warmer and the evenings longer, more of us will be
venturing outdoors so I'd urge everyone to heed our advice to help protect
themselves and our environment from wildfires."



 Alex Held of Working on Fire International said: "Fire investigation training,
in my experience, is an excellent toolkit for fire management in general.
Understanding fire behaviour, its influencing factors and the related effects in
the landscape are of immense value.



 "Fire Investigation can be used to increase our fire understanding, to
determine cause and origin, serve in court cases, deter arsonists and help to
target prevention campaigns better. In general, understanding the indicators of
a fire and reading its history makes you a better fire manager, leading to
better decision making."



 Such is the importance of the issue of wildfire that this seminar is being

TEXT:
 [*698]

   Introduction

 Imagine a forest that burns every ten years like clockwork. Someone acquires a
ten acre parcel within the forest, and, three years after the last fire, builds
a small cabin. Imagine also that there is a chemical that can be sprayed on the
forest that will prevent it from burning for three years, but that after three
years, the chemical will itself ignite, causing a wildfire. In year nine, the
government sprays the forest with the chemical. No fire occurs in year ten, but,
as expected, the chemical deployed by the government ignites in year twelve,
burning the forest and the small cabin.

   This stylized story reveals the puzzle of wildfire takings claims, and to a
degree, takings claims that arise out of other natural disasters like flooding.
In one sense, the government action - spraying the chemical - destroyed the
cabin. After all, the government deployed the chemical and the chemical directly
caused the fire; in legal terms, the spraying of the chemical appears to be the
"but for" cause of the damage suffered by the property owner. At the same time,
in the absence of the government's action, the cabin would have been destroyed
anyway - indeed, it would have been destroyed sooner. The government is, thus,
both the cause of the fire that destroyed the cabin and simultaneously the cause
of the landowner's reprieve.

   Reality mirrors this story of sprayed chemicals and burnt cabins because most
of the wildlands across the country in which development occurs burn in their
natural state with reasonable frequency and predictability. While no chemical
exists with the properties I have described, the government has long taken steps
to ameliorate the risk that wildfires will start, and to extinguish and manage
wildfires when they burn. Such efforts may delay the inevitable, but wildfire
always returns, and in many circumstances the delayed blaze may burn with
greater intensity and more destructive force. n1

    [*699]  The dynamics at play are important ones, because people increasingly
live and work in locations subject to the risk that wildfire will destroy
buildings, ravage landscapes, and, in extreme cases, claim lives. n2 Development
in fire-prone regions of the United States, often referred to as the
Wildland-Urban Interface ("WUI"), is explosive. n3 People flock to these areas
because they are beautiful, are located near natural amenities, and land prices
may be less expensive than those available in urban cores. n4

   Development also occurs, at least in part, because private property owners do
not bear many of the economic costs associated with wildfire risk. The
government - and in particular the federal government - consistently subsidizes
development in locations facing natural disaster risk, and wildfire is no
exception. n5 Federal taxpayers invest heavily in managing natural ecosystems to
reduce fire risk, and, when wildfires ignite, federal taxpayers (and to some
extent state and local taxpayers) fund efforts to control and quench wildfires.
n6 Public and private disaster relief also ameliorates the direct economic
consequences property owners experience from wildfires. n7

   The hefty price tag associated with wildfire prevention, response, and
recovery activities - to the tune of billions of dollars per year n8 - directly
[*700]  benefits private property owners. Therefore, investments in the built
environment appear economically rational from the perspective of a private
landowner, because the costs imposed by wildfire risk are significantly
displaced onto the general public. n9 While such subsidies do not avoid the
genuine and often acute feelings of personal loss experienced by those whose
homes are destroyed by wildfire - money from the government does not make an
individual who has lost their home and all it contains feel whole - they may
mute the effect that wildfire risk has on property value. n10 Cognitive biases
also affect perceptions of wildfire risk and these biases may further suppress
the effect of risk on the market price of property. n11

   Individuals whose property has suffered damage from wildfires predictably sue
the government, seeking compensation under the Takings Clause of the Fifth
Amendment, n12 although the doctrine of wildfire takings is much less mature
than that related to other disasters such as flooding because there have been
relatively fewer lawsuits. Following the Supreme Court's lead in other areas of
takings law, recent lower court decisions have, however, resisted a categorical
approach to addressing wildfire takings claims. n13 In so doing, these courts
have adopted what I will refer to as an "incident-centric approach" to wildfire
takings claims. Under this approach, analysis of the takings claim centers on
the specifics of the wildfire incident that caused harm to the property. n14 The
incident-centric approach, at its extreme, would mean that the owner of the
cabin in my opening story could recover compensation from the government because
the chemical deployed by the government caused the fire. This approach is in
contrast to what I will refer to as a "baseline-centric" approach to wildfire
takings claims in which analysis of the takings claim centers on  [*701]
baseline risk of wildfire to which a parcel of property is subject. n15 Under
this approach, the cabin owner could not recover because under natural
conditions the cabin would inevitably burn.

   As this Essay will explain, one consequence of the incident-centric approach
currently popular with courts is that cases may not be subject to early
disposition, requiring courts and government agencies to expend substantial
resources on factually intensive inquiries into exactly what occurred during the
course of a wildfire. Moreover, these inquiries are themselves often fraught
because wildfire response can be chaotic and rapidly evolving.

   The stylized story at the beginning of this Essay perhaps also reveals my own
perspective on how such claims should be treated. When people build within
wildlands that naturally burn, they act (or at least, should act) in full
knowledge of the inevitability of wildfire. The government, then, does not
unsettle those expectations when a wildfire occurs, regardless of whether a
governmental act was the immediate cause of that wildfire. Nor should the
government be viewed as the legal cause of the damage to the property. The
damage was bound to happen - the government at most influenced the timing, and,
as a general matter, the government's efforts have provided the property owner
with more time to enjoy and make use of their property than that owner would
have experienced had the forest been left unmanaged. n16

   Viewed in this light, the prospect of requiring the government to compensate
a landowner when wildfire management efforts result in damage to private
property is both doctrinally indefensible and bad policy. Such a compensation
award is nothing short of a direct subsidy for building in fire-prone locations,
increasing development and the attendant losses suffered when wildfires occur.

   This Essay advocates for rejecting the incident-centric approach in favor of
a baseline-centric approach. It does so in three Parts. Part I provides an
overview of naturally occurring wildfire risk and development activities in
risky locations. Part II provides an overview of wildfire takings claims,
identifying avenues for conceptualizing these claims and discussing three cases
in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or  [*702]  the
United States Court of Federal Claims that have resolved such claims. Part II
also reveals that courts have, to date, adopted an incident-centric approach to
wildfire takings cases. Part III identifies problems with the current approach
and then provides a doctrinal and policy justification for shifting to a
baseline-centric approach.

   Taking baseline risks seriously, as this Essay suggests courts should do,
will have salutary effects both on government wildfire response and on
development practices. While those owning property damaged in wildfires may
prove sympathetic plaintiffs in some cases, creating a system that further
encourages development in wildfire-prone locations will only expand the
vulnerability of people and the built environment to this natural risk and
simultaneously tax federal coffers.

   I. The Context of Wildfire Takings Claims

 Wildfire is a ubiquitous feature of natural landscapes. Prior to significant
human development, ecosystems across the United States routinely combusted, with
lightning strikes providing the spark to cause ignition. n17 As Stephen Pyne
wrote: "electrical fire operated on the earth's surface as soon as an atmosphere
evolved and vegetation appeared." n18

   While wildfire is inevitable in nature, its frequency and severity differs
across ecosystems. n19 Historically, some ecosystems, such as most of the forest
types in the southeastern United States and ponderosa pine forests in the
southwestern United States, experienced high frequency wildfires that would
return every few years; such fires were generally of a low intensity and only
cleared forest understory, rarely proving fatal to mature trees. n20 Other
forest ecosystems experienced more intense wildfires on the order of every few
decades, and such fires were more likely to constitute stand clearing events.
n21

   Even in the absence of human development and forest management, climate
change likely affects the natural baseline frequency of wildfires. In general,
climate change increases wildfire risk, making wildfires more frequent by
lengthening fire seasons, rendering forests more susceptible to disease
infestation, and generally increasing moisture loss. n22 As average  [*703]
temperatures rise, historic baseline conditions will generally underestimate the
frequency of wildfires in the absence of any human intervention.

   With only a few exceptions, most ecosystems experience a natural fire cycle
of sufficient frequency so as to be of consequence to human development. n23 In
other words, the natural baseline wildfire regime within natural landscapes is
such that improvements on property would be damaged by wildfire, irrespective of
human intervention, within the life expectancy of those improvements. This state
of intermittent wildfire in the absence of human intervention serves as a
baseline against which the effects of human activities - and of particular
import for this Essay, government activities - should be assessed.

   Over the last century, government agencies, particularly land management
agencies of the federal government, have been heavily involved in managing
forests and responding to wildfires. For decades, the Federal Government adopted
an aggressive fire suppression policy designed to squelch wildfires as soon as
they arose. n24 This policy was effective; between 1946 and 1978, wildfires
burned less than half the number of acres as had burned in earlier years. n25
While scientists and policymakers now agree that this robust wildfire
suppression policy had negative ecological consequences and allowed fuel loads
of dry timber and brush to build, increasing fire risk over time, n26 it is
difficult to dispute that this policy allowed those owning private property
within wildlands to enjoy a longer fire-free period than they would have enjoyed
in the absence of government intervention.

   As we now know, efforts at containment and suppression cannot postpone
wildfire indefinitely. n27 Developing property within wildlands is therefore a
risky business. Houses, businesses, and other built infrastructure face an
ongoing risk of wildfire and the inevitable reality of that risk materializing.
Nonetheless, an increasing number of people choose to live and work in these
locations. n28 In 2010, about ten percent of  [*704]  the territory of the
United States fell within the WUI, defined as "the area where structures and
other human development meet or intermingle with undeveloped wildland." n29 At
that time, the WUI was estimated to contain approximately one-third of
residential houses in the country, n30 and the Department of Agriculture
estimates that the number of houses within the WUI of the Rocky Mountains will
increase forty percent between 2006 and 2030. n31

   Humans have extensively settled areas with a significant baseline risk of
wildfire and continue to do so. Part of the reason for this is, of course, that
living in wildlands confers many benefits, and for some people the opportunity
to live in a beautiful location with easy access to outdoor recreation may
outweigh the risk of losing personal possessions to wildfire. n32 As the price
of housing in urban cores has increased, more rural locations have also become
increasingly attractive to prospective homebuyers. n33

   The market incentive for developers to build homes and other infrastructure
in wildlands, and for individuals to live and work in these regions, is
heightened by government policies that subsidize development in hazardous areas
and cognitive biases that cause individuals to discount disaster risk in making
decisions, thereby depressing the market signal that disaster risk would
otherwise send. n34 Such government subsidies are perverse because they not only
place people and infrastructure in harm's way, but also create incentives for
development that displaces open space and accompanying environmental,
recreational, and aesthetic public benefits. n35 This is a lose-lose
proposition: more development is placed at  [*705]  greater risk resulting in
ever-increasing economic losses all while consuming irreplaceable natural
amenities. As will be discussed below, recognizing a robust takings remedy for
those whose private property is damaged or destroyed by wildfire creates yet
another subsidy for this risk-seeking behavior. To understand the risks adherent
in such a takings subsidy, consider the ill effects created by subsidies that
already exist.

   Subsidies for development in areas subject to fire risks take several forms.
First, managers of publicly owned forests expend substantial resources in an
effort (not always successful) to mitigate and reduce wildfire risks. n36
Second, the government invests heavily in wildfire response. In 2015, the United
States Forest Service spent more than $ 1 billion on programs related to
wildfires, which was more than half of its budget for that year. n37 By 2025,
the agency expects the cost of wildfire programs to exceed $ 1.8 billion. n38
Third, disaster assistance programs provide significant funding for those whose
businesses or property are harmed by wildfires. n39 Unlike with other natural
disasters, few wildfires are declared major disasters by the federal government,
which means that relatively little assistance under the Stafford Act is
available to those who lose homes and businesses due to wildfire. n40 Wild-fire
related disaster declarations do, however, occur. For example, the Federal
Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA") provided nearly $ 1.3 million in federal
disaster assistance to Montana following a wildfire that occurred during the
[*706]  summer of 2012. n41 Both state and philanthropic programs also provide
substantial disaster relief. n42

   Financial subsidies conceal the true economic cost of developing within
fire-prone forests. n43 By artificially reducing the cost of development,
subsidies make it economically rational to build more homes and businesses.
Non-economic factors also skew perceptions of fire risk. Researchers have
identified an array of cognitive biases that can lead to a systematic
underappreciation of natural disaster risks. n44 The human brain tends to do a
poor job accurately comprehending low likelihood, high severity risks. n45
Additionally, because of the so-called "affect heuristic," our brains also tend
to view things that we like as relatively safe. n46 This means that a
prospective buyer who falls in love with a home nestled in the woods will likely
discount the risk that those woods may burn. People also fall prey to the
gambler's fallacy, which suggests once an unlikely event occurs, it is less
likely to occur a second time. n47 The availability heuristic may also skew risk
perception: this mental shortcut leads people to estimate risks based on the
ease with which they can think of examples of that risk manifesting, a poor
means of conceptualizing the likelihood of relatively rare events. n48 Thus,
inherent characteristics of human cognition can cause individuals to undervalue
the risks associated with wildfire, thereby cloaking economically irrational
decisions to invest in infrastructure in fire-prone locations in an illusion of
rationality.

   The operation of these cognitive errors and shortcuts on development is not
just theoretical. Studies of the effect of wildfires on housing prices confirm
that cognitive biases play a significant role in risk perceptions and
concomitant property valuation. Property values suffer in areas immediately
adjacent to recent wildfires, but otherwise remain stable in the region,
demonstrating what researchers have referred to as an ""out of sight, out of
mind' mentality." n49 The effect suggests that the availability heuristic,
[*707]  and particularly the salience of wildfire to prospective homebuyers,
skews risk perceptions, despite the fact that areas proximate to recent
wildfires may be no more at risk (and potentially at less risk) than areas in
similar ecological settings further from recent fire activity. n50

   The various mechanisms that distort incentives to develop in the WUI provide
a backdrop for the consideration of wildfire takings claims. Wildfires are a
natural and ubiquitous element of natural ecosystems; nonetheless, development
of such ecosystems occurs at a dramatic pace, increasing the vulnerability of
the built infrastructure to wildfires, and property values and development
decisions do not adequately reflect wildfire risk because of government
subsidies and cognitive biases. These dynamics reinforce one another. As more
construction occurs within the WUI, the economic value of the built environment
threatened by wildfire will increase, as will the demand for governmental
activities to minimize fire risk and suppress wildfires once ignited.

   II. Dimensions of Wildfire Takings

 An increasing number of people owning increasingly valuable property in
wildfire-prone locales will predictably lead to an increasing amount of
litigation in the wake of wildfires. Some of this litigation will involve
private property owners seeking compensation from the government under the Fifth
Amendment's Takings Clause. n51 This class of cases - wildfire takings claims -
has yet to achieve the maturity of other areas of takings law. Relatively few
cases have been brought and, until recently, the government has been successful
in defeating claims at an early stage. n52 But a recent preliminary victory for
a property owner in a wildfire takings case, n53 along with related successes in
the context of takings claims related to flooding, n54 suggests that this is
likely to be a burgeoning field.

   This Section begins by considering two approaches that courts could take to
wildfire takings claims: the incident-centric approach and the  [*708]
baseline-centric approach. It then examines three cases decided by either the
Federal Circuit or the Court of Federal Claims, each of which adopted an
incident-centric approach to the wildfire takings claims at issue.

   A. Theoretical Approaches

 In general terms, courts could frame wildfire takings claims in one of two
ways. First, the court could consider the natural setting involved, taking
particular account of a property's baseline wildfire risk, and whether, as a
result of that naturally occurring risk, wildfire is an expected hazard in the
ecosystem. Second, the court could consider the particular wildfire that caused
damage, the governmental action alleged to have caused or contributed to that
wildfire, and any potential justification for that action.

   As I have already explained, the vast majority of ecosystems experience
naturally occurring wildfires of reasonable frequency - on the order of years or
decades. n55 In these wildlands - let us call them fire-prone wildlands - it may
be impossible to predict precisely when a fire will occur, but we can predict
with virtual assurance that a fire will occur eventually. A few ecosystems -
such as certain desert ecosystems - experience extremely infrequent wildfires.
The floor of Death Valley, for example, is predicted to experience wildfire only
once in a several millennia. n56 While these ecosystems - let us call them
fire-poor wildlands - are rare, the difference in natural baseline risk would
feature prominently in the analysis of a takings claim under a baseline-centric
approach. n57 A court might distinguish between baseline conditions under which
that owner should reasonably foresee wildfire damaging her property - where
property lies within a fire-prone wildland - and baseline conditions that
indicate that an owner should not reasonably foresee such damage - where
property lies within a fire-poor wildland.

   A court considering baseline wildfire frequency would need to understand the
natural setting of a plaintiff's private property. Such an assessment would only
require inquiry into background biological facts and would not involve
consideration of the cause of the precise fire that harmed a plaintiff's
property or the nature of the governmental response. n58 In other words, this
potential framing of a wildfire takings claim focuses on risk of wildfire rather
than the events surrounding any singular wildfire that occurs. While there are
numerous reasons to believe that baseline wildfire risk  [*709]  should be
relevant, or even dispositive, of a takings claim - as will be discussed below -
courts have not yet placed analytic weight on this facet of a wildfire takings
claim.

   Instead of utilizing this baseline-centric approach, a court could utilize
the incident-centric approach and analyze the specifics of the particular
wildfire that caused harm to a plaintiff's property, and this is the approach
that courts have tended to adopt. While there are myriad activities that the
government could undertake related to a wildfire, let me identify four rough
categories of government action that could be implicated in a wildfire takings
claim. Category One: the government manages a public wildlands and a plaintiff
alleges that management (or alleged mismanagement) increased the risk of fire.
Category Two: the government ignites a controlled burn to reduce fire risk and
that controlled burn - either inadvertently or intentionally - spreads to
private land. Category Three: the government actively responds to a wildfire but
its response does not protect the plaintiff's property. Category Four: the
government actively responds to a wildfire, and as part of its response ignites
a backfire to consume fuel in the wildfire's path, intentionally burning the
plaintiff's property. n59

   A focus on the specifics of a particular wildfire may also require a court to
consider the government's justification for its action. The government could,
for example, justify its action as a necessary response to an exigent
circumstance, invoking the so-called "public necessity" defense, which is a
longstanding hallmark of property law. n60 Government could also assert that a
particular government action was necessary to mitigate a significant risk. n61

    [*710]  Courts have taken this latter course and focused on the specific
incident attendant to a wildfire and the government's justification for any
response it undertook, both issues which may require a searching inquiry into
the specific facts of a particular wildfire and wildfire response. That does not
mean that a plaintiff will prevail and secure compensation, but such an inquiry
imposes significant litigation expense on the government and may create
incentives for settlement. The baseline-centric approach, on the other hand,
requires much less factual development and, if viewed as dispositive, could
allow for early resolution of cases in the government's favor. As I will discuss
below, as a matter of doctrine and policy, takings claims should not be
permitted for those owning land in fire-prone wildlands, and such a shift in
focus would have the side benefit of reducing the judicial and litigation
resources needed to resolve these claims.

   B. Wildfire Takings Cases

 The Court of Federal Claims and the Federal Circuit have handled three wildfire
takings claims worthy of consideration. n62 The first two cases - Cary v. United
States n63 and Teegarden v. United States n64 - represent what may be an old
paradigm for wildfire takings cases: one in which the government prevails with
relative ease and without significant factual development of the record. The
third case - TrinCo Investment Co. v. United States n65 - represents what may be
a new paradigm that permits plaintiffs to force discovery related to government
decisionmaking processes. These three cases not only demonstrate disparate
approaches to takings claims, but they also cut across the categories of
government action identified above, falling within Category One - forest
management activities, Category Three - failure to protect property during
active wildfire response, and Category Four - engaging in backburning that
damages private property as part of active wildfire response. n66 In both the
[*711]  old paradigm cases and the new paradigm case, the courts focused on the
particulars of the government action at issue, rather than the general nature of
the wildland subject to the fire.

   In Cary v. United States, n67 the Federal Circuit addressed a Category One
case. The plaintiffs' land was burned after a lost hunter deployed a signal
flare that ignited a wildfire. n68 The plaintiffs alleged that Forest Service
management practices had increased the risk of a high-intensity fire like the
one that damaged the plaintiffs' property, and therefore the plaintiffs should
receive compensation from the federal government. n69 The Federal Circuit
affirmed dismissal of the case holding that the plaintiffs had failed to
properly allege that the fire that burned their property was the "direct,
natural, or probable" result of the Forest Service's management activities, but
instead had only alleged that those management activities increased the risk of
a fire within the forest. n70 As the court explained, no single management
decision had set the fire in motion, but rather the Forest Service had engaged
in "a long sequence of decisions, some risk-increasing but others
risk-decreasing, spread out over decades." n71 The court also concluded that the
plaintiffs' claim failed because the wildfire that damaged their property
appropriated no benefit to the government, and, in fact, the government's
interests were also harmed by the fire. n72

   In Teegarden v. United States, n73 the Court of Federal Claims addressed a
Category Three case. The Uinta Flat Fire ignited on July 15, 1989, and rapidly
grew in size. n74 In fighting the fire, the Forest Service issued a directive to
firefighting personnel prioritizing the protection of "life and property,"
including "summer homes," and areas of "high commercial timber values." n75 The
plaintiffs owned properties that fell into neither category, and the fire spread
to their property. n76 The court entered summary judgment for the United States,
explaining that while the Forest Service's prioritization may have resulted in
the fire spreading to plaintiffs'  [*712]  land, the Forest Service did not
intend to take the plaintiff's property. n77 Instead, the Forest Service
utilized the limited resources it had to protect as much property as possible.
n78 The court further concluded that the Forest Service's actions were not the
legal cause of any property damage because the "plaintiffs cannot escape the
incontrovertible fact that the Uinta Flat Fire, not the Forest Service, caused
the destruction of their property." n79 Unlike in Cary, the court here disposed
of the case at summary judgment, although the court's causation analysis would
seem to lend itself to a relatively easy and early resolution of the case in the
government's favor.

   In TrinCo Investment Co. v. United States, n80 the Federal Circuit addressed
a case falling into Category Four and reversed a district court order granting a
motion to dismiss in favor of the government. As part of an effort to fight the
Iron Complex fire, the Forest Service lit backfires adjacent to and on the
plaintiffs' property. n81 The Court of Federal Claims dismissed the case finding
that the Forest Service's action was justified under the doctrine of public
necessity because the action was part of the Forest Service's efforts to fight
the Iron Complex fire. n82 The Federal Circuit explained that the doctrine of
public necessity could insulate the government from liability. n83 It held,
however, that Court of Federal Claims erred in resolving the issue at the motion
to dismiss stage because the government could only properly invoke the public
necessity defense if igniting the backfire in such a way as to damage the
plaintiffs' properties was necessary to address an actual emergency. n84 Making
that determination required facts outside the complaint. n85 As the court
explained: "It is certainly plausible that the Iron Complex fire did not pose an
imminent danger or actual emergency necessitating the destruction of such a
sizable portion of TrinCo's property." n86 As a result, the court believed that
there were "legitimate questions as to imminence, necessity, and emergency,"
[*713]  each of which required factual development before the Court of Federal
Claims. n87

   TrinCo can be viewed as a paradigm shift, replacing an approach to wildfire
takings claims that had allowed the government to successfully prevail early in
the life of a case with one that requires substantial factual development. The
new approach envisions a searching inquiry into the government action, both in
terms of precisely what steps the government took, and also what knowledge
government officials possessed in establishing a course of action for fighting
the wildfire. TrinCo also appears to place the burden of proof on the
government, requiring it to prove that the precise action undertaken was
necessary to respond to an emergency, n88 while in both Cary and Teegarden the
courts held that the plaintiffs had failed to carry their burden of establishing
that the governmental action constituted a taking in the first place.
Alternatively, TrinCo, despite its enhanced skepticism about governmental fire
management activities, n89 can be read in harmony with Cary and Teegarden. As
Category One and Category Two cases, Cary and Teegarden addressed situations
where the government did not directly ignite the fire that harmed private
property. In other words, the government may still be able to prevail with
relative ease, so long as it can disclaim responsibility for lighting the
wildfire that burns private property.

   III. Reconsidering Wildfire Takings

 Wildfire takings cases are likely to become increasingly frequent. The (few)
existing cases suggest that the Federal Circuit and Court of Federal Claims are
likely to take an incident-centric approach to such claims - meaning that the
courts will focus their analysis on the specific incident that resulted in harm
to private property, rather than the background wildfire risk inherent in
ownership of that property. In my view, this approach is wrongheaded. This
Section explains the problems with the incident-centric approach and justifies
the alternative, baseline-centric approach in terms of both doctrine and
practical consequence.

[*714]

   A. Problems with the Incident-Centric Approach

 There are a number of problems with the current approach by which courts focus
their attention on the particular incident that caused damage to private
property, rather than the property's baseline wildfire risk.

   First, the incident-centric approach arbitrarily distinguishes between owners
that have suffered identical harms, preferencing the claims of those whose
property is coincidentally damaged by a fire ignited by the government, rather
than those whose property is damaged by a fire ignited either naturally or by
non-governmental actors. n90 On one hand, the plaintiffs in TrinCo may be able
to recover compensation from the government, and will likely force the
government to expend significant resources in discovery, because the Forest
Service ignited backfires on their land before an existing wildfire could reach
them. The plaintiffs in Cary, on the other hand, may not be able to recover
because a wayward hunter, and not the government, ignited the blaze. In cases
like Cary, a court could conceivably conclude that the government involvement on
the wildland had been the direct cause of the wildfire, even if the government
itself had not caused the ignition. In both cases, private property was damaged
when publicly owned forests burned, but the former plaintiff has a much greater
likelihood of securing compensation.

   Second, the current approach - in particular the current approach to the
necessity doctrine - appears to improperly import notions of fault into takings
jurisprudence. Takings doctrine should identify those circumstances where
governmental action is "functionally equivalent to the classic taking in which
government directly appropriates private property or ousts the owner from his
domain." n91 Such inquiry presupposes the legitimacy of governmental action and
focuses on the burden experienced by the landowner, rather than the carelessness
of the government. A claim that the government has acted carelessly should sound
in tort, not in takings, and the Federal Circuit's approach to the public
necessity doctrine would stand this proposition on its head. n92

   Third, the current approach creates disincentives for sensible forest
management practices to reduce wildfire risk. More than one billion acres
[*715]  of wildlands are subject to enhanced wildfire risk because of excessive
fuel. n93 Appropriate use of prescribed burns can mitigate this risk by reducing
fuel loads, and commentators have called upon government agencies to
substantially increase the use of prescribed burns. n94 Agencies already face
substantial obstacles in implementing prescribed burns on a large scale, in no
small part because land management agency budgets are already committed to
funding firefighting activities, leaving little funding available for wildfire
mitigation. n95 In addition, the existing environmental law regulatory regime
creates obstacles to prescribed burns. For example, Kirsten Engel has
persuasively argued that the Clean Air Act, as currently implemented, creates
perverse incentives that discourage prescribed burns, despite the health effects
of prescribed burns being better than those associated with uncontrolled,
cataclysmic wildfire. n96 The possibility of a compensation remedy under the
Takings Clause could further discourage such sensible practices that would
result in healthier ecosystems, less air pollution, and less economic losses
from wildfires. Despite their best efforts, government agencies will on occasion
lose control of prescribed burns, and if courts were to require the government
to pay compensation under the Takings Clause in such eventualities, this could
substantially reduce the willingness of forest managers to engage in such
activities.

   Similarly, the liability rule envisioned by TrinCo may interfere with
wildfire fighting efforts. Governmental officials face formidable challenges in
containing wildfires. These efforts cost substantial government funds n97 and
rapidly evolving conditions on the ground can jeopardize the lives of
firefighting personnel and individuals caught unaware. n98 Emergency personnel
should not face the specter that every decision they make will be  [*716]
second-guessed by a judge in a proceeding seeking compensation from the
government. In coordinating a wildfire response, government personnel must make
rapid strategic decisions to ensure the safety of human life and limit the
damage caused by wildfires. n99 They should not also be thinking about ensuring
that they have an adequate record to demonstrate that their actions fall within
the public necessity defense. Existing case law also suggests that takings
liability will generally not exist when the government fails to protect property
from wildfire, but affirmative fire response efforts could create liability. In
other words, when the government attempts to protect lives and property by
actively fighting wildfires, it exposes itself to potential liability that would
not exist if the government took no action. This serves as a disincentive for
government to take action at all. While other incentives - both political and
humanitarian - will likely result in governmental actors continuing to intervene
in many circumstances, distorting emergency response in a fashion that
encourages inaction (in the absence of demonstrated benefits of such inaction)
is counterproductive. n100

   Fourth, and most importantly from my perspective, a compensation rule
functions as a subsidy for ownership and development of private property in
wildfire-prone ecosystems. This subsidy would augment existing subsidies that
encourage unwise and inefficient development and redevelopment, placing
increasing numbers of people and amounts of infrastructure in harm's way. n101
Such subsidies are particularly troubling because they reinforce cognitive
distortions that cause individuals to undervalue natural disaster risks.

   Others have recognized that subsidizing development in areas prone to
wildfire is bad policy and increases the vulnerability of people and the built
environment. Two student Notes have recently taken up the topic in significant
detail. Garrett Trego has suggested creation of programs by  [*717]  federal,
state, or local governments to address wildfires that would be funded by special
assessments imposed on property owners within the WUI. n102 Benjamin Reilly has
suggested that the federal government should attempt to shift the costs of
wildfires to property owners through a federal insurance scheme. n103 Whatever
the appropriate response to dealing with the perverse incentives created by
existing subsidies, we should avoid expanding those subsidies and thereby
further increasing vulnerability, something which would result in robust
wildfire takings claims.

   B. An Alternative Path

 Another path exists. Rather than focusing on the specific fire that damaged
private property, courts could consider the baseline fire risk facing that
property. Wildlands naturally burn and infrastructure within their borders will
naturally be damaged or destroyed, with or without government intervention.
Those who make decisions to purchase and develop property within such wildlands
do so knowing of this possibility. In such circumstances, the government should
not have to compensate the owners of property damaged by a predictable natural
hazard.

   I would suggest, then, that courts should recognize a categorical limit to
wildfire takings liability, but it should not arise from analysis of a
particular governmental action that may have caused or contributed to the damage
suffered by a property owner. Rather, compensation should not be awarded under
the Takings Clause when wildfires occur in fire-prone wildlands. n104

   Such a categorical approach recognizes that certain natural hazards
essentially adhere to property ownership. The Supreme Court has recognized that
background legal principles attach to title such that operation of one of those
principles can never support a takings claim, even if the property has lost all
value. n105 Similarly, background ecological principles - such as wildfire risk
- should be viewed as attaching to property, and when property experiences a
manifestation of those background ecological principles, takings claims should
be barred.

   Several aspects of takings doctrine support such a categorical rule. The
reasonable expectations of property owners have always been a  [*718]
cornerstone of takings liability. n106 Those choosing to develop within wildfire
-prone wildlands do not have a reasonable expectation that wildfire will not
visit their property, and without such a reasonable expectation, takings claims
should fail. The Supreme Court's treatment of the takings claims at issue in
Arkansas Game & Fish Commission v. United States n107 supports this view that a
property owner's reasonable expectations, and therefore their ability to secure
compensation from the government, are connected to the naturally occurring risks
facing the property. n108 In that case, a property owner - an agency of the
state of Arkansas - sought compensation from the United States when the Army
Corps of Engineers' management of a dam led to flooding downstream. n109 During
oral argument, Justices Kennedy, Alito, and Sotomayor all asked questions
related to trying to identify what baseline should be used to determine whether
the flooding at issue could be attributed to the government. n110 Toward the end
of the argument, Justice Sotomayor posed the question most precisely, asking:
"Is the baseline ... before the dam or after the dam, and why is it one or the
other? If flooding was going to occur more unpredictably before the dam, and
possibly summer flooding of this kind could have happened, do you lose?" n111

   The Court's ultimate decision in Arkansas Game & Fish Commission also
addressed in passing the baseline issue. The Court explained that the property
at issue "had not been exposed to flooding comparable [to that at issue in the
case] in any other time span either prior to or after the construction of the
Dam." n112 This statement suggests that had the flooded property been subject to
historical floods of the character at issue in the case, the property owner may
not have had a reasonable expectation that flooding would not recur, and
therefore the takings claim would have failed.

   The general concept of reciprocity of advantage also supports the rule I
suggest. n113 This concept, which suggests that property owners should not
[*719]  be able to recover compensation from the government where the losses
they experience are offset by "the advantage of living and doing business in a
civilized community," n114 is implicit in much of takings law. n115 The concept
has significant application to wildfire takings claims. The federal government
invests heavily in managing publicly owned wildlands and responding to wildfires
when they occur, spending billions of dollars a year to fund these endeavors.
n116 These efforts, while not always successful, cost the taxpayer dearly and
provide property owners with longer periods of repose between episodes of
wildfire than they would experience absent government action, periods during
which a property owner can enjoy improvements on her property and recoup her
investment. This valuable benefit counterbalances losses suffered when wildfire
eventually (and inevitably) burns infrastructure within fire-prone wildlands. At
such time, property owners have no legitimate demand for payment from the
government because they have already been the recipient of substantial
government benefits.

   Economic research about the effect of wildfires on property values bolsters
the case for reciprocity of advantage in this context. n117 Even if federal
policies have resulted in less frequent, more severe wildfires, that may be the
type of event that enhances property value on the whole. Evidence suggests that
the negative effect of wildfire on property value relates directly to frequency,
n118 meaning that prolonged periods without wildfire improve the situation of
property owners vis-a-vis the market. While a natural regime that includes
frequent, low intensity fires may pose less threat of direct harm to physical
infrastructure, frequent fires would appear likely to more significantly depress
property values. Less frequent, higher intensity wildfires would, on the other
hand, result in greater risk of harm to physical infrastructure, but property
values would be less sensitive to this risk except in the immediate aftermath of
a wildfire.

   Finally, causation principles favor a rule that bars compensation claims.
Where wildlands predictably burn as a result of their environmental attributes,
no particular fire should be viewed as causing injury. Rather,  [*720]  property
faces a persistent risk of fire damage, and the decision to build in a risky
location should be viewed as the cause of the eventual injury. n119

   There may, of course, be wildfire that occurs in a location that did not
experience historical fire cycles. In such circumstances, an examination of the
governmental action and its justifications may be warranted. But such
circumstances are likely to be rare. While only three cases, it is notable that
Cary, Teegarden, and TrinCo all occurred within western wildlands that
experienced recurring wildfires in their natural state.

   Disallowing takings recovery for property owners that choose to develop in
hazard-prone areas also allows market signals to more accurately price risk.
This, in turn, facilitates better, more rational, and more socially optimal
development decisions. Because development in hazard-prone areas imposes costs
on the public and consumes scarce natural resources, the takings rule suggested
in this Essay has both a sound doctrinal basis and serves important public
policy goals.

   IV. Conclusion

 The destruction caused by wildfires has become a ubiquitous component of the
news cycle. n120 More people live in wildfire-prone wildlands, and climate
change and a buildup of fuels results in more frequent and more intense
wildfires. Each year taxpayers spend more money to fight wildfires. And this
trend is likely to continue. At the same time, we can expect to see more
lawsuits filed against the federal government (and perhaps state and local
governments too) seeking compensation when wildfires damage private property.
That likelihood is partially a numbers game - more people experiencing more harm
will lead to more lawsuits - and partially a feature of a paradigm shift that
may be represented by the Federal Circuit's recent decision in TrinCo.

   Rather than taking an incident-centric approach to wildfire takings claims,
courts would do better to take baseline natural conditions seriously. Where
private property is naturally subject to wildfire risk, claims for compensation
should be barred when that risk materializes and wildfire damages the property.
Such a rule has numerous salutary effects. Perhaps its most significant effect,
however, is that categorically barring such claims avoids the creation of
another subsidy for developing in wildfire-prone ecosystems.

    [*721]  A baseline-centric approach to wildfire takings claims will mean
that most property owners will have no claim for compensation against the
government. That outcome reflects that those who purchase and develop property
within wildfire-prone ecosystems do so despite the wildfire risk facing such
property. This does not, of course, mean that no property owner may ever recover
under any legal theory. Under the right circumstances, where the government has
acted carelessly, a property owner could conceivably bring suit under state tort
law. Such lawsuits will be difficult to win because of limitations inherent in
bringing tort suits against the government, but that difficulty does not justify
distorting the law of takings.

Takings Clause was originally understood only to require compensation in

Circuit Provided the Tinder to Burn Down the Public Necessity Defense in
Wildfire Takings Cases?, 48 Colum. J.L. & Soc. Probs. 373 (2014-2015). The
Supreme Court recognized the common law defense of public necessity in Bowditch
v. City of Boston, 101 U.S. 16, 18-19 (1879), a case that involved the
destruction of a building to contain a fire in Boston. See Lucas v. S.C. Coastal
Comm'n, 505 U.S. 1003, 1029 n.16 (1992) (identifying as a background principle
of law the rule that "absolves the State (or private parties) of liability for
the destruction of "real and personal property, in cases of actual necessity, to
prevent the spreading of a fire'").





n61.  The government could, in other words, argue that it took action to abate a
public nuisance. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 202 (1965) ("A public
officer who by virtue of his office or by statute is authorized to abate a
public nuisance, is privileged, at a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner,
to enter land in the possession of another for the purpose of abating such a
nuisance."). The Supreme Court has suggested that the common law of nuisance,
which authorizes abatement actions, constitutes a background principle of state
law that, if properly invoked, can immunize the government from the obligation
to pay compensation. See Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1029 (noting that a "confiscatory
regulation[]" would not require compensation if it coincides with "the
restrictions that background principles of the State's law of property and
nuisance already place upon land ownership").





n62.  These two courts have exclusive jurisdiction over takings claims brought
against the United States. See 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1) (2012) (waiving sovereign
immunity of the United States for monetary claims seeking damages in excess of $
10,000 so long as the complaint is brought in the Court of Federal Claims); 28
U.S.C. § 1295(a)(3) (2012) (providing the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit with exclusive jurisdiction over appeals taken from U.S. Court of
Federal Claims); Justin R. Pidot, Eroding the Parcel, 39 Vt. L. Rev. 647, 655
n.39 (2015). Claims against the United States seeking monetary damages less than
$ 10,000 may be brought in any federal district court, 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2)
(2012), but takings claims in that amount are rarely brought.

n66.  The Federal Circuit has not heard a takings claim related to Category Two
- property damage resulting from a controlled burn set to mitigate fire risk.
Tort claims have been brought against the United States in such circumstances
alleging that the government negligently carried out a controlled burn. See,
e.g., Anderson v. United States, 55 F.3d 1379 (9th Cir. 1995). Surprisingly, the
Ninth Circuit's decision in Anderson did not address the discretionary function
exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act's ("FTCA") waiver of sovereign
immunity, 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a) (2012). In Green v. United States, however, the
Ninth Circuit concluded that the discretionary function exception did not apply
in certain circumstances involving controlled burns.  630 F.3d 1245 (9th Cir.

owner whose property had been damaged by a back burn).

n88.  Id. at 1380 ("The necessity defense is just what it says it is: a

n89.  In the closing line of the opinion, the court states: "It would be a
remarkable thing if the Government is allowed to take a private citizen's
property without compensation if it could just as easily solve the problem by
taking its own." Id. at 1380. While this statement may have a certain
common-sense appeal, it is entirely unclear how the government would go about
demonstrating that emergency response efforts fully considered actions that
avoided harm to private property in the face of a rapidly evolving situation.





n90.  In other contexts, takings law does draw arbitrary lines between those who
may secure compensation from the government and those that may not. See Pidot,
supra note 12, at 157. In the context of wildfire takings claims, however, the
experience of the owner whose land is burned by a naturally occurring fire and
the owner whose land is burned by a government-ignited fire is virtually
identical and courts should hesitate before developing rules that treat the two
parties differently without adequate justification.





n91.  Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 539 (2005).





n92.  Courts should be particularly wary of incorporating analysis of the
appropriateness of governmental action into takings doctrine. Through the
so-called substantially advanced test in Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255,
260 (1980) the Supreme Court attempted to adopt this approach, which the Court
had unanimously repudiated in Lingle, 544 U.S. at 540-41.

regulatory climate has created between resource agencies and air agencies, which
is a dynamic that has impeded the use of prescribed burns. Id. at 669. She also
notes that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") discounts smoke from
wildfires when it assesses compliance with ambient air quality standards but not
smoke from prescribed burns. Id. at 652-53. This occurs because wildfires are
deemed natural and prescribed burns human-caused. Id. at 651. Engle urges the
EPA to repudiate this policy and consider all smoke from wildfires as part of
assuring air quality compliance. Id. at 664.

n99.  My view that firefighters should make decisions without worrying about the
potential for triggering governmental liability is at odds with that expressed
by Susan Kuo, who favors liability rules as a means of avoiding inefficient
wildfire suppression techniques. See Susan S. Kuo, Disaster Tradeoffs: The
Doubtful Case for Public Necessity, 54 B.C. L. Rev. 127, 128 (2013). Kuo argues
that the government should be liable for losses property owners incur during the
government's disaster response activities because otherwise private property
owners are being asked to subsidize - by absorbing losses - governmental
provision of disaster protection, which she views as a public good.  Id. at
129-30. In my view, Kuo's argument ignores that private property owners in
wildfire-prone ecosystems receive substantial subsidies themselves and providing
a compensation remedy merely enhances those subsidies.





n100.  This is not to say that scholars and government officials should not
carefully examine wildfire response efforts for their effectiveness, efficiency,
and ecological consequence. See, e.g., Karen M. Bradshaw, Backfired! Distorted
Incentives in Wildfire Suppression Techniques, 31 Utah Envtl. L. Rev. 155, 156
(2011). Formulating better policies to shape wildfire response is an important
task. But such evaluation should be done retrospectively. Attaching financial
penalties to certain wildfire suppression techniques because they require
affirmative governmental action would not appear to lead to more ecologically or
economically sound practices.

n102.  Trego, supra note 6, at 617-22.





n103.  See Reilly, supra note 6, at 543, 560. In light of the failure of the
National Flood Insurance Program to achieve actuarially sound insurance rates,
see, e.g., Pidot, supra note 5, at 255-56, I am pessimistic that a federal
insurance program would accurately price risk.





n104.  Other remedies may be available. If government employees act negligently,
for example, property owners could file tort suits. See Anderson v. United
States, 55 F.3d 1379, 1384 (9th Cir. 1995). Such lawsuits may face challenges
due to the limited waiver of sovereign immunity embodied in the FTCA, but
concern about the extent to which the government has provided for tort lawsuits
should not be a reason to recognize a more expansive takings remedy.

concept:



   The necessary reciprocity of advantage lies not in a precise balance of
burdens and benefits accruing to property from a single law, or in an exact
equality of burdens among all property owners, but in the interlocking system of
benefits, economic and noneconomic, that all the participants in a democratic
society may expect to receive, each also being called upon from time to time to
sacrifice some advantage, economic or noneconomic, for the common good.

Similarly, when wildfires damage private property, the cause, at least in part,
is the decision of the owner to build in a risky location.

Idaho: Risch, Crapo, Western Senators Introduce Bill to Improve Fire Recovery
and Mitigation Efforts

LENGTH: 443  words



Boise: The Senate Office of James e. Risch of Idaho has issued the following
news release:  U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jon
Tester (D-MT), Jim Risch (R-ID), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) today introduced the
Wildfire Mitigation Assistance Act to provide resources to assist communities
recovering from damaging wildfires. The bill treats wildfires in the same manner
as other natural disasters by making available Hazard Mitigation Assistance
funding to states affected by catastrophic wildfires.   "Wildfires have
catastrophic effects across the West," Bennet said.

"We can dramatically reduce the severity and damage from these wildfires through
mitigation work that minimizes the risk of flooding, erosion, and future fires.
This bill would make it easier for affected communities to receive federal
resources for post-fire recovery and mitigation efforts."   "Throughout the
American west, we have felt firsthand the devastation wildfires have on our
habitat, our health and our way of life," Crapo said.  "The Wildfire Mitigation
Assistance Act would allow fire-prone communities to apply for Hazard Mitigation
grants through the Federal Emergency Management Agency in order to undertake
'fire-wise' projects for homes in the wildland urban interface or to reduce
hazardous fuels.  Congress must continue to pursue efforts aimed at reducing the
risk and severity of wildfires, as well as improve the response, prevention and
mitigation efforts."  "I have seen firsthand the impact that catastrophic
wildfires have on our communities," Tester said. "Folks impacted by wildfire
need assistance long after the flames stop burning, and this bill will help
ensure that folks on the ground can restore land impacted by fire and better
prevent future disasters."  "Massive wildfires destroy homes, businesses, and
ecosystems in the west just like catastrophic hurricanes destroy communities in
coastal regions," said Risch. "This bill will help local governments in Idaho
and across the west deal with the aftermath of large wildfires."  "Wildfires
have unfortunately proven once again to be the West's natural disasters," Wyden
said. "This is urgent business that requires an equally urgent and comprehensive
response. This bill marks a key piece of that response to help people recover
from the devastation of wildfires by providing funding to local governments to
reduce flooding and erosion after fires, monitor stream and habitat health and
assist residents in clearing brush from around their homes and businesses."

NIEA hosts international wildfire investigation seminar

LENGTH: 1077 words



 Belfast: Northern Ireland Executive, UK Government has issued the following
news release:



 A two-day international wildfire investigation seminar 'Wildfires, Don't
Speculate, Investigate!', took place earlier this week in Newry.



 The first to be held on the island of Ireland, the seminar was organised to
help fire protection professionals better understand wildfires in order to
improve prevention measures and develop their investigative skills.





 Accurately determining the origin of a wild land fire and its cause is an
essential first step in a successful fire investigation. Proper investigative
procedures during a fire's initial stages can more accurately pinpoint its cause
and preserve valuable evidence that might be destroyed by fire-fighting
activities.



 If a wild fire is caused by human action, the recommended protective measures
can preserve evidence that may lead to effective and fair administrative, civil,
or criminal actions.



 Speaking from the seminar, Colum McDaid who leads on wildfire control
initiatives in the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) said: "The impact
of uncontrolled wildfires on habitats in Northern Ireland is of significant
concern. Given the large scale damage that uncontrolled wildfires can cause, it
is essential to raise awareness of the issue and provide practical guidance to
both control and prevent uncontrolled wildfires.



 "Wildfires are uniquely challenging in terms of prevention, suppression and
investigation. By identifying the causes of wildfires fire protection
professionals can design better safeguards to prevent others, which will help
reduce the loss of property and habitat in the long term.



 "The vigorous and thorough investigation of wildfires is the key to catching
arsonists and can be critical in identifying serial arsonists before they might
move on to bigger targets.



 "The law states that burning of vegetation such as heather, gorse, whin or fern
must not be carried out between 15 April and 31 August, and only carried out at
other times of the year under controlled and expert supervision. In addition, it
should be noted that any burning within a designated site such as an Area of
Special Scientific Interest may need consent from DAERA.



 "As the seasons grow warmer and the evenings longer, more of us will be
venturing outdoors so I'd urge everyone to heed our advice to help protect
themselves and our environment from wildfires."



 Alex Held of Working on Fire International said: "Fire investigation training,
in my experience, is an excellent toolkit for fire management in general.
Understanding fire behaviour, its influencing factors and the related effects in
the landscape are of immense value.



 "Fire Investigation can be used to increase our fire understanding, to
determine cause and origin, serve in court cases, deter arsonists and help to
target prevention campaigns better. In general, understanding the indicators of
a fire and reading its history makes you a better fire manager, leading to
better decision making."



 Such is the importance of the issue of wildfire that this seminar is being
followed up by a knowledge exchange visit by two wildfire officers from the
Dutch Fire and Rescue Service next week. During their visit they will see at
first hand the work being undertaken to reduce the incidence of wildfires. They
will share their knowledge and expertise with the NIEA, Northern Ireland Fire
and Rescue Service, the Department of Agriculture Food and Marine (RoI) and the
National Parks and Wildlife Service (RoI).



 Mark Smyth, Group Commander and NIFRS Lead Officer for Wildfires added: "During
2015/16 we attended 1,439 gorse fires and already this year we have dealt with
the first gorse fires of the season. While the overall number of gorse fires has
reduced in the last three years, it remains a significant community problem.



 "We know that the majority of gorse fires we attend are started deliberately
but given the nature of these fires and their rapid fire spread, identifying the
exact origin and cause of the fire can be difficult. Learning from the
experience of Fire Investigators from other countries and sharing our own
experiences and techniques has been invaluable.



 "Alongside partner agencies and community groups, we have been working hard to
address the problem of gorse fires and educate people about the dangers and
consequences of deliberate fire setting both to themselves, their community and
on NIFRS.  We will continue to work in partnership tackle this issue and to
further reduce gorse fires happening in Northern Ireland."



 The messages about the impacts of wildfires and how to avoid them are clear and
simple:



     Wildfires are not natural - they are almost always started by humans either
deliberately or by being careless;

     Wildfires put lives at risk - they could result in tragedy for people
caught in the line of fire. Dealing with these types of incidents puts not only
firefighters' lives at risk but the lives of everyone in the local community.
Firefighters are diverted from other emergencies and contingency plans have to
be put in place to ensure continued emergency cover for towns and villages
across Northern Ireland - this may result in a slight delay when responding;

     Wildfires cost everyone - the whole community, as well as businesses that
provide much needed employment. Between 2005 and 2010 £35 million was spent on
fighting wildfires alone;

     Wildfires destroy our surroundings - how they look and the wildlife in
them;

     Wildfires are illegal - deliberate setting of wildfires is a criminal
offence.



 If you are in the countryside:



     Extinguish cigarettes and other smoking materials properly;

     Never throw cigarette ends out of car windows;

     Only use barbecues in designated areas and never leave them unattended;

     Ensure that barbecues are fully extinguished and cold before disposing of
their contents;

     Avoid using open fires in the countryside;

     Do not leave bottles or glass behind - sunlight shining through glass can

Public safety first priority of B.C. Wildfire Service

BYLINE: Doug Donaldson, Times Colonist

SECTION: COMMENT; Pg. A17

LENGTH: 463 words


Nick Raeside is certainly correct in saying that wildfire management practices
have changed in British Columbia since 1957 ("The changing face of B.C. forest
fires", Oct. 8).

The challenges that the B.C.

Wildfire Service faces have also changed dramatically over the past 60 years,
due in part to increased development in rural areas, the impact of mountain pine
beetle infestations on our forests and the growing effects of climate change.

Because the province's landscape is continually evolving, our government's
approach to fire prevention and wildfire management is also constantly being
evaluated and improved. The B.C. Wildfire Service is a recognized world leader
in these areas.

It is truly remarkable and a testament to the tireless efforts of our
firefighters, air crews, support staff, private contractors and partner agencies
that, during one of the worst wildfire seasons ever, not one human life was
lost, and property damage was limited.

B.C.'s wildfire management professionals use advanced firedetection and
firefighting technology to "hit hard and hit fast."

In recent decades, that approach has been coupled with a better understanding of
wildfire behaviour and how fire can help renew forests where lives and property
are not at risk.

Our first priority is public safety. Our frontline firefighters are trained
professionals, and we also rely on the assistance and expertise of local
contractors and first responders. We also use expertise from across government
in an effective and efficient way to meet challenging wildfire situations.

The B.C. government is working with the federal government and other Canadian
jurisdictions to achieve the goals outlined in Wildland Fire Strategy: A 10-year
Review and Renewed Call to Action. The strategy recognizes that a cohesive,
national approach is needed to focus on fire prevention and ensure that we are
all better prepared to deal with catastrophic wildfire threats. The strategy's
objectives include helping communities become more fire-resilient, promoting
healthier and more productive forest ecosystems, and continuing to develop
state-of-the-art wildfire preparedness and response capabilities.

The B.C. government also fully supports the use of FireSmart principles and
prescribed burning to reduce wildfire risks around communities. As part of our
new government's 2018 budget update, we've allocated $140 million for wildfire
-risk reduction, reforestation, forest rehabilitation and wildlife habitat
restoration, and to raise public awareness of the FireSmart program.

As it has always done, my ministry will continue working to mitigate the effects
of wildfires on the landscape and protect B.C.'s communities. Doug Donaldson is
B.C.'s minister of forests, lands, natural resource operations and rural
development.

Washington: Oregon Members Applaud Inclusion of Emergency Wildfire Suppression
Assistance in Spending Bill

LENGTH: 803  words



Washington: Office of the MP Kurt Schrader has issued the following news
release:

Rep. Kurt Schrader (OR-05), along with Reps. Peter DeFazio (OR-04), Greg Walden
(OR-02), Earl Blumenauer (OR-03), and Suzanne Bonamici (OR-01) today applauded
the inclusion of emergency funding for wildland fire suppression in the
supplemental appropriations bill just passed by the House of Representatives.
This comes a week after Congressman Schrader led a bipartisan letter to the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) calling on the Administration to include
"comprehensive forest management and wildland fire budgeting reforms as part of
the next disaster relief request as soon as possible."
The Oregon lawmakers have repeatedly urged House leaders to include funding for
the US Forest Service (USFS) in the wake of massive fires that have burned
nearly 700,000 acres across Oregon. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue has
announced that Fiscal Year 2017 has been the most expensive firefighting year on
record.


"Fixing the way we pay for wildfire suppression and prevention has been one of
my legislative priorities since coming into federal office over eight years
ago," said Congressman Schrader. "For the past three Congresses, I've introduced
a bipartisan bill to put an end to the practice of fire-borrowing. I am very
pleased that this disaster is receiving needed funding, and is being treated
with the seriousness it deserves. We have a long way to go in the work to curb
wildfires and the devastation they inflict, but securing this funding is an
encouraging step forward."
"I'm happy to see Congress acknowledge the pressing need for additional funding
for wildfire suppression in one of the worst fire seasons in decades," said
Peter DeFazio. We must take steps to ensure the USFS and Department of Interior
have the funding they need,  such as considering wildfires to be natural
disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes. Without such steps, the destructive
cycle of fire-borrowing will only continue."
"I am proud to have worked with the administration and my colleagues in the
Oregon delegation to secure this much-needed funding to cover the cost of
devastating wildfires across our state and much of the West," said Rep. Walden.
As another fire season raged on, once again, the Forest Service needed to rob
money from important fire prevention work to pay for fighting wildfires. This
bill replenishes those accounts to pay for the cost of this fire season, but it
is past time that we fix how we pay for fires and treat them like the natural
disasters they are. It's also past time for Congress to fix federal forest
policy and address the underlying issues leading to catastrophic fires that
choke our skies and communities with smoke each summer."
"Spurred by climate change, we've witnessed millions of acres in the West
exploding in out-of-control wildfires--touching Oregon's own beloved Columbia
Gorge," said Rep. Blumenauer. "The House took a step in the right direction by
approving much-needed funding to help those communities affected. More must be
done, however, to end fire-borrowing and make sure agencies have the resources
they need."
"The wildfires this season have been devastating to Oregon. They have destroyed
large portions of forestland, reduced air quality across the state, and left a
lasting mark on many communities," said Congresswoman Bonamici. "I thank all of
the firefighters and first responders who worked endless hours to keep
Oregonians safe. I'm pleased that Congress is working together to increase
funding for fighting fires, and hope we can finally put an end to the practice
of fire-borrowing."
In June, Congressman Schrader reintroduced his bipartisan Wildfire Disaster
Funding Act along with Congressman Mike Simpson (R-ID) to fix the current
budgeting process for wildfires. In recent years, Congress has budgeted for
wildfire suppression by appropriating money according to the average cost for
wildfires over the past ten years, known as the "ten-year average."  When costs
exceed an agency's fire budget, that agency is forced to borrow from non-fire
accounts to pay for fire suppression. This practice is known as
"fire-borrowing." Fire borrowing was intended to be an extraordinary measure to
help in bad wildfire years. However, this practice has become the norm and not
the exception, which has caused wildfire costs to increase. According to the
Forest Service, wildfire costs were 56% of their total budget in 2016. In 1995,
the Forest Service spent only 16% of their total budget fighting wildfires. By
2025, that number could increase to nearly 70% if nothing is done to fix the
budgeting process. The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would end fire borrowing by
treating wildfires like other natural disasters when wildfire suppression costs
are exhausted.

Replenish wildfire reserve fund

BYLINE: Rapid City Journal

SECTION: OPINION; Pg. A6

LENGTH: 293 words


While the Black Hills are fortunate so far this year in not having a major
wildfire (knock on wood), the rest of the nation hasn't been as lucky. As of
Tuesday, the U.S. Forest Service was fighting 25 large wildfires in the country,
the largest being the 235,841-acre Rim Fire in California.

The Forest Service said it was almost out of money to fight wildfires, having
spent $967 million already this year. With only $50 million left in its fire
suppression budget, the Forest Service is diverting $600 million from timber,
recreation and other areas.

But by raiding funds from forest management programs, the Forest Service is
cutting programs aimed at preventing wildfires in the first place.

That's short sighted. In a quiet wildfire season that South Dakota has seen this
year, removing fuels near urban areas is exactly what state and local agencies
should be doing.

The threat of wildfires in the national forests is extremely unpredictable and
increasingly expensive. Last year, the Forest Service spent more than 40 percent
of its budget on wildfires, up from 13 percent of its budget nearly 20 years
earlier.

In 2009, Congress created a wildfire reserve fund, known as the FLAME Act, but
if the Forest Service is running through the reserve fund and has to raid forest
management programs to continue to fight wildfires, Congress is not
appropriating enough money for wildfire suppression.

We're all for reducing bloated federal budgets, but spending priorities need to
be set. Fighting wildfires and forest management programs are spending
priorities that need to be fully funded.

When Congress returns from its August vacation, it needs to appropriate
additional money to the Forest Service to fight wildfires and responsibly manage
our national forests.

California: 2015 Wildfire Awareness Week Kicks Off May 3rd

LENGTH: 530  words

DATELINE: Sacramento


City of Redwood, The State of California has issued the following news release:

The Redwood City-San Carlos Fire Department joins the annual State of
California/CALFIRE campaign, Wildfire Awareness Week, which kicks off on May 3,
2015 and ends May 9, 2015.

The Redwood City-San Carlos Fire Departments, along with fire departments
throughout the nine Bay Area County's, want to raise the public's awareness of
wildfires. Promoting these actions will; save lives, reduce the extensive damage
to homes and the natural lands of a community from wildfires. Each year,
thousands of acres of land and countless homes are destroyed by wildfires. State
and local fire officials want citizens to remember to prepare by remembering
this basic term "Ready, Set, Go!":

Be Ready for a wildfire starts by maintaining 30 to 100 feet of defensible space
around the home.
    Be Set by having an evacuation plan and Wildfire Action Plan.
    Lastly, when a wildfire strikes, put your evacuation plan in effect and Go!

Remember, "One Less Spark, One Less Wildfire!" According to fire officials,
approximately 95 percent of all wildfires are sparked by the activity of people,
which means that almost all wildfires are preventable. One of the leading causes
of wildfires is outdoor power equipment. Use powered equipment before 10:00 a.m.
and never on hot and windy days. Make sure your vehicle is properly maintained
with nothing dragging on the ground like trailer chains. All residents and
vacationers need to be extra cautious outdoors because one less spark means one
less wildfire.

The Redwood City-San Carlos Fire Department is using this state campaign to
remind residents of these somber statistics and urge residents - especially
those who live in hilly portions of Redwood City, San Carlos, and the
unincorporated San Mateo County - to clear brush and grasses to a minimum of 30
feet to 100 feet from their homes or to the property line, whichever comes
first. Doing so creates the defensible space as required under State Law, and
greatly reduces the potential of wildfires destroying homes. The Redwood City
Fire Department-San Carlos Fire Department staff will be continuing the
vegetation inspection program until the drought period to greatly decrease the
risk of wildfires.

Specific methods for performing the clearing of dead or dry vegetation can be
viewed by visiting the Fire Safe Council of San Mateo County site at
www.smcfiresafe.org and CAL FIRE at www.fire.ca.gov. (The Redwood City and San
Carlos Fire Departments are active members of the Fire Safe Council of San Mateo
County.)

"Wildfire Awareness Week is another opportunity to remind residents that it is
within their power to stop the ravaging of our Peninsula land by taking simple
steps to protect not only their home, but the families in our broader
community," states Jim Palisi, Redwood City-San Carlos Fire Marshal. "Hundreds
of homes along the Peninsula are vulnerable to this type of event and will be
destroyed. This kind of loss can be minimized if residents took some basic fire
prevention steps."

California fire burns buildings as residents balk at leaving

BYLINE:  Associated Press

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A15

LENGTH: 471 words


SANTA CLARITA, Calif. - A raging wildfire that forced thousands from their homes
on the edge of Los Angeles continued to burn out of control Monday as frustrated
fire officials said residents reluctant to heed evacuation orders made
conditions more dangerous and destructive for their neighbors.

The smoky fire tore through drought-ravaged brush that hadn't burned in decades
amid a sweltering heat wave and exploded over the weekend. It burned more than
51 square miles and destroyed at least 18 residences.

Firefighters were unable to battle some of the blaze because of evacuation
holdouts they had to spend time helping to safety instead of putting out
destructive flames, County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said.

Some firefighters "felt that they lost additional structures because they had to
stop what they were doing to help citizens evacuate," Osby said.

U.S. Forest Service spokesman Justin Correll urged residents to leave quickly
when evacuation orders are issued because their "property becomes secondary."

"We don't want firemen to become traffic directors," he said.

The fire was one of two destructive infernos burning in California. A blaze in
the scenic Big Sur region of the Central Coast had destroyed 20 homes and
threatened 1,650 others by Monday as it burned 23 square miles.

In Santa Clarita, 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, a fire broke out
Friday near a highway and quickly spread through arid vegetation in rugged
mountains before making its way down into canyons with sprawling subdivisions of
large homes.

By Monday, about 10 percent of Santa Clarita's 200,000 residents had been
ordered out of their homes.

The wind-driven fire kicked up Saturday like a "crazy storm," said Kara
Franklin, who said sand driven by heavy wind hit her in the face as she tried to
get a horse and donkey into a trailer so she could tow the animals away. From a
ridgetop, she saw flames engulf a neighborhood.

When the blaze appeared to die down, she thought the worst was over and
returned. Then it flared up again and she and her son used a garden hose to put
out embers that ignited spot fires on her property before fleeing.

"The heat was so intense," Franklin said Monday from a high school that had been
turned into an evacuation center. "It was an inferno that was blazing ... just
coming over the ridge."

Three Forest Service firefighters lost their homes at a remote fire station in
the San Gabriel Mountains, including two who were fighting the fire at the time.

The fire destroyed film sets at Sable Ranch in Santa Clarita, which has Old
West-style buildings used for movie locations. It also forced a nonprofit
sanctuary for rescued exotic creatures to evacuate 340 of its more than 400
animals, including Bengal tigers and a mountain lion.

Nearly 3,000 firefighters were trying to put the Santa Clarita blaze out.

Global Warming responsible for rise in wildfires

BYLINE: Gloria Bradley

LENGTH: 373  words


A rise has been witnessed in the number of wildfires taking place in the Western
United States. Experts have been majorly blaming global warming for uptick in
wildfires. Researchers from University of Wyoming have unveiled that even a
smallest increase in temperature could result into a dramatic increase in
wildfire activity.

Due to global warming, we can witness a new era of high-elevation wildfires that
have not been seen in over 1,000 years. More than 50,000 wildfires have happened
this year and those blazes have destroyed more than 9 million acres in the West
and Alaska in 2015.

Experts think warming in Alaska is the main reason behind huge wildfires there.
The research paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences has unveiled that even a small amount of wildfire could have a massive
effect on wildfire.

Study researchers have studied charcoal samples representing 2,000 years of
wildfire taken from lake beds in a subalpine forest in northern Colorado's Mount
Zirkel Wilderness near Steamboat Springs. Through this, the researchers were
able to measure the increased wildfire frequency in a period of global warming
that was similar to current conditions.

The period was Medieval Climate Anomaly that was around 1,100 to 1,200 years
back. "Our study then adds more evidence that the recent increase in large
wildfires is related to climate change because the only time we see these types
of large wildfires in the last 2,000 years is when we had a similar amount of
warming", said John Calder, study's lead researcher.

"We don't know how the other mountain ranges burned in the region, but expanding
this study into other mountain ranges is something I would like to do," Calder
said.

"We will live in a different West. This is happening now, and it will continue
happening. It will be a new normal," said John Calder, a UW PhD student and
co-author of the paper, "Medieval warming initiated exceptionally large wildfire
outbreaks in the Rocky Mountains."

is   born

BYLINE: BEPPI CROSARIOL; GAM

LENGTH: 985 words


By BEPPI CROSARIOL
 If all technologies made possible by the microchip, the sexiestowith the
possible exception of the home page for lingerie model Frederique of the
Victoria's Secret catalogueohas got to be speech recognition. So far,
though, products such as dictation software for PCs and those aggravating
new directory assistance operators that you get when you dial 411 seem
mostly to be demonstrating that the technology isn't ready for prime time.

Then there's Wildfire. Billed as the world's first 24-hour, seven-days-
a-week receptionist, Wildfire may just be speech recognition's "killer
application" and a big beacon of hope to those of us who can't wait for
talking toasters.

At its core, Wildfire is a personal computer linked to the central
phone switch in an office. But it sounds and acts like a pleasant, hyper-
efficient receptionist. To get Wildfire's attention, you say "Wildfire."
From there, it's a matter of following her prompts. (Yes, it's only
available in female.)
   A typical conversation might go like this: "Wildfire]" "Here I am."
"Send a message.o -To whom?o -Bill Gates.o -At which place?o -The
Porsche.o -What's the message?" "Bill, with all due respect, that last
offer was an absolute joke. I mean, my employees, they're practically
family. And didn't I read you just spent more on a da Vinci doodle pad?
Get back to me."

Wildfire's voice-dialling feature really comes in handy when you're out
of the office. To save on usurious long-distance rates in certain
countries, for example, you can ask Wildfire in Canada to call you every
day at your hotel in Vietnam, say, where long distance to North America
costs about $15 a minute versus $3 to $4 from Canada to Vietnam. Wildfire
will even pronounce your name and room number to the front-desk operator.
Once the connection's established, at Canadian calling rates, you can have
Wildfire dial out, hands-free, with impunity, bypassing hotel charges too.

Wildfire can also screen and juggle incoming calls as nimbly as Rush
Limbaugh's switchboard censor. Let's say you're on the phone and a second
call comes in. Wildfire will pick it up, ask for the caller's name and
then discreetly whisper it into the ear end of your phone handset. To take
the call and put the current party on hold, you'd say, "Wildfire, press
the hold button." To avoid an incoming call from Revenue Canada, you'd
simply ignore Wildfire (by not uttering the name) and a message would be
taken.

Some early Wildfire users gush like infomercial hosts on uppers. "I'm
completely addicted," says Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the
Future, in Menlo Park, Calif., reached at the San Francisco airport while
on another, clearly less-mportant call. "Life as I know it would end
without Wildfire." He especially extols the call-screening feature.
"Ninety years after the fact, we're civilizing the telephone. You're not
going to pick up a phone without knowing who's calling."

Which is not to say that Wildfire has been spreading like its namesake.
When it was launched in 1994, the $50,000 (U.S.) systemofrom tiny Wildfire
Communications Inc., of Lexington, Mass.owas aimed at managers who'd
unfortunately just blown their office telecom budgets through the roof on
keypad-operated voice-mail systems. Lately, though, sales to independent
service bureaus have started to pick up, and individuals and small
businesses can now rent the service for about $6 (Canadian) per person a
day (EMIT Corp. of Toronto has just launched Canada's first Wildfire
service; call (416) 761-9770 or type dmelymuk@msi.net).

Current sales aside, Wildfire proves an important pointothat it's now
possible to cram a useful and reliable speech-recognition software product
onto a mere $3,000 Pentium-based PC. Unlike error-prone PC dictation
systems, which are practically useless without a keyboard to fall back on
and which force you to strain your vocal cords by uncomfortably pausing
between words in long sentences, Wildfire needs no human backup. It won't,
for example, hang up on a confused caller without first defaulting into
answering-machine mode. Says Saffo: "It degrades gracefully." And as for
those new 411 systems, they only understand the words "English," "French,"
"residential" and "business." The rest of the call is merely recorded for
the benefit of an overworked operator who can't afford to listen to your
hemming and hawing.

In fact, the big phone companies look at a system like Wildfire and
drool. Pierre Boisseau, manager of corporate communications for Nortel
Technology, the research arm of Northern Telecom Ltd., which makes network
equipment used by Canadian phone companies, says Nortel is working on its
own electronic receptionist, due in a couple of years. "We foresee speech
rec-ognition becoming the ultimate interface between humans and machines
on the telephone network."

At IBM, arguably the world leader in speech-recognition research,
there's a palpable feeling that the technology's time has come. Alan
Hilliard, general manager of software for IBM Canada Ltd. in Markham,
Ont., says the challenge is no longer technological but rather the cost of
the processing power. And 1996 is turning out to be a watershed year on
that score.

There's now a robo-steno at IBM's futuristic lab in Yorktown Heights,
N.Y., that Hilliard says can transcribe dictation the length of an entire
page of The Wall Street Journal, in real time, without prior voice
training, with 100% accuracy. Okay, to buy it today, you'd have to pay
about $100,000. But later this year, IBM will launch a Pentium-based PC
system that can accomplish the same thing, except that the user still must

Smoke from wildfires may be surprisingly deadly

BYLINE: Chris Mooney The Washington Post

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. P11C

LENGTH: 970 words


As firefighters continue to battle California's devastating Thomas Fire - now
the fourth-largest in state history - a group of scientists presented new
results suggesting that air pollution from such massive blazes may be one of
their deadliest consequences.

Speaking at the annual American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans, the
researchers, from Colorado State University and the University of Houston,
suggested Thursday that wildfires may be responsible for thousands of U.S.
deaths annually due to the tiny pollution particles they put into the
atmosphere. Moreover, just as fires are expected to worsen under climate
warming, so might these health impacts.

"If this is the new norm for California . . . and people in California are being
exposed to these smoke events regularly, then we would expect this to have an
impact on the average lifetime of people in California, said Jeffrey Pierce, a
professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University who presented his
preliminary results at the meeting and a news conference afterward.

Just like smokestacks and tailpipes, wildfires fill the air with the by-products
of combustion, including very dangerous small particles known as PM2.5, which
can get into the lungs and bloodstream. A growing body of research has
demonstrated that these particles degrade health and contribute to thousands of
deaths each year in the United States alone by causing respiratory,
cardiovascular and other health problems.

So just how deadly is the smoke from wildfires? While the numbers presented this
week are definitely preliminary, they suggest the cost could be severe indeed.

Pierce presented the highest numbers at the meeting. He estimates that between
5,000 and 25,000 people in the U.S. may die each year at present from PM2.5 that
specifically comes from the smoke of wildfires burning in the United States and
other nearby countries (such as Canada). But the number of wildfire-linked
deaths could triple by the end of the century for high levels of global warming,
he has found, based on one climate modeling scenario (which, Pierce emphasizes,
is only a preliminary finding and should be replicated by other scientific
groups).

That would lead to a situation in which, as other sources of air pollution
decline, wildfires become an increasingly dominant overall source of PM2.5.

"Coal plants have gotten cleaner, wildfires have slightly increased over the
past decades, so, wildfires are on the verge of becoming, if they haven't
become, the largest source of particulate matter in the U.S., said Pierce in an
interview.

Pierce's results, not yet published formally, are similar to those of Ebrahim
Eslami, a PhD student at the University of Houston who also presented at the
meeting on wildfire-related air pollution deaths. He has found that wildfires
and other burning of biomass, such as in the agricultural sector, contribute to
around 5,000 deaths per year. That equates to annual economic damages between
$40 and $50 billion for the period between 2011 and 2014.

"Billions of dollars, or tens of billions of dollars, that's the magnitude of
the cost caused by wildfires due to health impact incidence, Eslami said.

The studies include not only the effects of raging wildfires, but also
controlled burns, in which forest managers deliberately light fires to burn away
some of the fuel and reduce the danger of more dangerous outbreaks later. The
health effects are of course not evenly distributed - they are the worst in
areas closest to large wildfires, such as California, the Pacific Northwest and
U.S. southeast.

While Pierce's and Eslami's results are not yet formally published, they don't
sound so different from a just published result from a group of scientists with
the U.S. EPA and several Australian institutions. These researchers found that
"short term premature deaths tied to wildfire air pollution in the U.S. from
2008 through 2012 numbered between 1,500 and 2,500 each year. They calculated
that the economic toll, meanwhile, was tens of billions each year.

And these were only short term effects - over the longer term, the researchers
calculated even more severe numbers.

Other recently published work has found that the air pollution contributed by
wildfires has been greatly underestimated and that in the western U.S. during
wildfire seasons between 2004 and 2009, fires contributed 12 percent of the
total PM2.5 concentrations in the atmosphere, and far more than that on days
with particularly poor air quality. The research projected that this situation
would get considerably worse due to climate change.

Many health outcomes less severe than death are also triggered by wildfire
smoke, particularly in the immediate vicinity of fires, such as asthma attacks
and hospital trips for a variety of conditions.

"A severe short-term smoke event increases the number of [asthma] inhaler
refills by an order of magnitude, said Katelyn O'Dell, a researcher at Colorado
State who is working with Pierce studying the health effects of wildfires, at
the news conference in New Orleans.

Granted, all of these findings should be taken cautiously, because this research
is fairly novel. Moreover, researchers acknowledge that wildfire smoke differs
in complex ways from other types of air pollution - and indeed, depends on where
wildfires occur, and what they consume.

"What burns matters, said Manvendra Dubey, a researcher at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, who is also working on the problem of wildfire smoke and its
consequences. Dubey underscored the complex chemistry of the smoke that emanates
from different types of fires at the New Orleans meeting.

So there is much more to learn about the dangers of wildfire smoke - but based
on the little we know so far, it sounds like a serious threat, and one that
could grow even worse in the future.

Off-road vehicles restricted in backcountry

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 469 words


BC Wildfire Service

KAMLOOPS - Effective at noon (Pacific time) on Friday, Aug. 4, 2017, the
operation of any off-road vehicle for recreational purposes on Crown land will
be prohibited throughout the Cariboo Fire Centre, Kamloops Fire Centre and
Southeast Fire Centre. In addition, all on-highway vehicles must remain on
defined road surfaces.

"During the current wildfire situation, it's crucial that we do everything we
can to prevent human-caused wildfires. Temporarily removing off-road vehicles
from the backcountry is another component of our wildfire prevention strategy,"
said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and
Rural Development.

This step is being taken to help prevent human-caused wildfires and protect
public safety. The operation of any off-road vehicles in these regions during
the current wildfire situation creates a potential wildfire risk. While jeeps,
trucks and other on-highway vehicles are permitted on designated roads, they are
not allowed off-road.

The prohibition of off-road vehicles and on-highway vehicles does not apply to
private lands or national parks. It also does not apply to emergency responders
or to agriculture or commercial/ industrial users who operate vehicles for
farming, emergency response or business purposes.

A map of the affected areas is available online at: http://ow.ly/QTm330e9G5n

August is traditionally the most active part of the wildfire season. Given the
number of fires currently burning in B.C., the elevated fire danger ratings and
the extremely dry conditions in many parts of the province, the BC Wildfire
Service is strongly urging British Columbians and visitors to stay out of the
backcountry in these regions.

The BC Wildfire Service is continually monitoring conditions and this
prohibition may be expanded or rescinded as needed.

In addition, the public is reminded that almost all provincial parks and all
recreation sites and trails within the Cariboo Fire Centre are closed due to
wildfire risk. The travelling public should visit "safety tips for B.C.
travellers" at: www.bcwildfire.ca

Anyone found in contravention of this off-road vehicle prohibition may be issued
a violation ticket in the amount of $767. If the contravention causes or
contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all
firefighting and associated costs.

To report an off-road violation, call the RAPP line at: 1 877 952-7277.

To report a wildfire or open burning violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or
*5555 on a cellphone. For the latest information on current wildfire activity,

Jackson, MS,  April 01, 2018 --(PR.com)-- The Mississippi Forestry Commission's
(MFC) public service announcement video, Stop Wildfires at the Starting Line,
won a silver ADDY at the American Advertising Federation (AAF) Jackson awards in
the category of Public Service Television Commercial. The award-winning public
service announcement was produced by the Jackson-based video production and
advertising firm Mad Genius and received grant funding from the U.S. Forest
Service. World's Fastest Woman, Olympic Gold Medalist Tori Bowie is featured in
the thirty-second public service announcement, which intends to remind the
public of the destructive power of wildfires and how quickly they can spread.

The American Advertising Awards, formerly the ADDYs, is the advertising
industry's largest and most representative competition, attracting over 40,000
entries annually. The mission of the American Advertising Awards competition is
to recognize and reward the creative spirit of excellence in the art of
advertising. Silver ADDYs are given to entries that are considered outstanding
and worthy of recognition in their respective categories.

"We are proud of the collaborative effort between our Public Information
Department and Mad Genius to create this outstanding public service
announcement," said Charlie Morgan, State Forester, Mississippi Forestry
Commission. "Our hope is that it will help people realize the best way to
prevent devastating wildfire occurrences is never to let one start."

Wildfire prevention month

Governor Phil Bryant proclaimed March as Wildfire Prevention Month in
Mississippi. Historically, March has one of the highest wildfire occurrence
rates of the year due to the weather transition from winter to spring, dry
vegetation, and windy conditions. Since January 1, 2018, the Mississippi
Forestry Commission (MFC) responded to and suppressed 440 wildfires that burned
6,231 acres. MFC Wildland Firefighters saved 799 homes and structures. Wildfire
activity destroyed or damaged 23 homes and structures. Help the MFC Stop

Washington: Wyden, Crapo, Bipartisan Senators to Congress: Permanent Wildfire
Funding Fix Must be a Top Priority

LENGTH: 1259  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Ron Wyden has issued the following news
release:

In the wake of historic wildfires in Oregon, Idaho, California, Washington and
across the West, U.S. Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., Jim Risch, R-Idaho, Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Michael Bennet,
D-Colo., introduced an updated version of their bipartisan wildfire funding
solution that would protect desperately needed funding for fire prevention and
treat wildfires as the natural disasters they are.


The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act of 2017 would end the destructive cycle of
borrowing from fire prevention accounts to put out fires and stop the erosion of
the Forest Service's budget by reforming the way the federal government funds
wildfires.
"Oregonians and westerners are battling another record-breaking fire year. The
threat of catastrophic wildfires is growing, yet the federal government
continues to conduct 'business as usual' when it comes to fighting fires in
Oregon and the West," Wyden said. "More communities are put in danger and fire
prevention work gets left undone because of a backwards fire budgeting system.
It's past time for Congress to make it a top priority to end fire borrowing,
stop the erosion of the Forest Service becoming the 'Fire Service' and start
treating wildfires like the natural disasters they are."
"If you live in a community in the western United States, you do not need to be
told that wildfires are major natural disasters," Crapo said. "With over eight
million acres burned, ten states choked with smoke, and lives and structures
lost, this year's fire season is a brutal reminder that we must start treating
mega fires as the disasters that they are. Now is the time to both recognize
that fires are major disasters and end the destructive cycle of fire borrowing
that only makes the fire situation in this country worse."
Unlike for other natural disasters, where agencies can draw from an emergency
fund to pay for disaster response, the U.S. Forest Service and Interior
Department do not have access to disaster funds and are forced to "fire borrow"
- or steal money from fire prevention and other important programs already
funded in their agencies to pay to put out fires.
Currently, federal agencies calculate wildfire suppression budgets based on the
average costs of wildfire suppression over the past 10 years. But as fire
seasons grow longer and wildfires have become more expensive to fight, Congress
is forced to appropriate more funding to an outdated budgeting system that
almost always underestimates the actual cost of fighting fires.
The updated bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would fund wildfires as
natural disasters and protect the agencies' fire prevention budgets by putting a
freeze on the rising budget costs of the 10-year average. It would end "fire
borrowing" by allowing the agencies to fund any fire suppression spending needed
above the frozen average through disaster funding just like other agencies can
access disaster funding for tornadoes, hurricanes and floods.
Making disaster funding available after the appropriated fire suppression funds
are spent would allow the Forest Service to use its fire prevention funding for
its intended purpose - completing hazardous fuels reduction projects that have
been shown to help break the cycle of increasingly dangerous and costly fires.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that this year has been
the single most expensive fire year on record, with fire suppression activities
totaling more than $2 billion. Addressing the current, problematic system of
wildfire funding is part of a larger need to stabilize and update emergency
spending for all natural disasters.
Earlier this month, Wyden and Crapo, along with 10 other Democratic and
Republican senators urged Senate Leaders Mitch McConnell and Charles E. Schumer
to include a wildfire funding fix in any future disaster aid legislation that
passes through Congress.
Find bill text for the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act here.
Feinstein: "Wildfires have already burned millions of acres this year across the
West, and the fire season is far from over. It's long past time we treat
wildfires like other natural disasters and allow federal agencies to pay for
them like other natural disasters. Our bipartisan bill would end the need for
so-called 'fire borrowing,' where funding for fire prevention efforts is
diverted to fighting wildfires, delaying or canceling critical prevention work.
We must empower federal agencies with the tools they need to protect public
safety and get ahead of what could be yet another catastrophic fire year."
Risch: "The West is on fire, and it's burning faster than years prior. We need
every resource available to prevent and combat the devastation caused by
wildfires. This legislation would ensure those of us in the West can count on
much-needed disaster funding."
Cantwell: "Fifty percent more acres have already burned this year than normal
and the trends of the last few years suggest this will likely be our new normal.
The bill we are introducing today will stop the fire-borrowing that is currently
crippling the Forest Service."
Hatch: "Wildfires continue to decimate Western communities, ruining sources of
drinking water, destroying property, and even claiming lives. Wildfires have all
the qualities of a natural disaster, and it's time that the federal government
treat them as such. This critical legislation gives much-needed relief to the
Forest Service by putting an end to funding requirements that make it all but
impossible for the agency to bear the increased costs of wildfire suppression.
Ultimately, our bipartisan proposal will leave the Forest Service better
prepared to fight forest fires and better equipped to prevent them from
happening in the first place. It is imperative that we to return to a more
balanced approach to forest management, not just fire management. I am confident
that this bill will help foster safer, healthier forests in Utah and across the
West for years to come."
Merkley: "The way we fund wildfire suppression today is counterproductive and
crazy. As this fire season has proven all too vividly, robbing from forest
health and fire prevention programs to pay for suppression only creates a
vicious cycle of bigger and bigger fires. It's time to fix this problem once and
for all by funding fighting the biggest wildfires the way we do other natural
disasters."
Gardner: "It may not be getting headlines in the national news, but wildfires
have burned millions of acres in the West this year and the communities impacted
in Colorado need assistance. I've been working to advance this legislation to
stop fire borrowing for several years, and I appreciate the strong bipartisan
support to ensure the Forest Service has the funds it needs for clean-up and
prevention efforts while also finally requiring the government to treat
wildfires like it does other natural disasters."
Bennet: "Catastrophic wildfires continue to plague the West, not only
threatening communities and livelihoods but also draining the Forest Service
budget. We need to restructure the way we pay for fighting catastrophic fires to
mitigate and prevent future wildfires. This bill would end the practice of fire
borrowing--a necessary step that will enable the Forest Service to make
responsible investments on the front end to restore our forests and safeguard
our watersheds."

Washington: Schrader Applauds OMB Request for $576.5 Million Towards Wildfires

LENGTH: 389  words



Washington: Office of the MP Kurt Schrader has issued the following news
release:

Congressman Kurt Schrader (OR-5) released the following statement in response to
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)'s announcement that $576.5 million
toward wildfire funding will be included in their supplemental budget request to
Congress this week. This announcement comes after Congressman Schrader led his
colleagues in the Western Caucus in calling on the Administration to include
"comprehensive forest management and wildland fire budgeting reforms as part of
the next disaster relief request as soon as possible."
"Fixing the way we pay for wildfire suppression and prevention has been one of
my legislative priorities since coming into federal office over eight years
ago," said Congressman Schrader. "For the past three Congresses, I've introduced
a bipartisan bill to put an end to the practice of fire-borrowing. I am very
pleased that this Administration is treating this disaster with the seriousness
it deserves. We have a long way to go in the work to curb wildfires and the
devastation they inflict, but this announcement is an encouraging step forward."

In June, Congressman Schrader reintroduced his bipartisan Wildfire Disaster
Funding Act along with Congressman Mike Simpson (R-ID) to fix the current
budgeting process for wildfires.

In recent years, Congress has budgeted for wildfire suppression by appropriating
money according to the average cost for wildfires over the past ten years, known
as the "ten-year average."  When costs exceed an agency's fire budget, that
agency is forced to borrow from non-fire accounts to pay for fire suppression.
This practice is known as "fire-borrowing." Fire borrowing was intended to be an
extraordinary measure to help in bad wildfire years. However, this practice has
become the norm and not the exception, which has caused wildfire costs to
increase. According to the Forest Service, wildfire costs were 56% of their
total budget in 2016. In 1995, the Forest Service spent only 16% of their total
budget fighting wildfires. By 2025, that number could increase to nearly 70% if
nothing is done to fix the budgeting process. The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act
would end fire borrowing by treating wildfires like other natural disasters when
wildfire suppression costs are exhausted.

Washington: Costa Statement on Introduction of Wildfire Disaster Funding Act

LENGTH: 444  words



Washington: Office of the MP Jim Costa has issued the following news release:

Yesterday, Representative Jim Costa (CA-16) joined Representatives Mike Simpson
(ID-2) and Kurt Schrader (OR-5) to introduce the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act
of 2017. The legislation addresses the budgeting process for fighting wildfires,
aiming at fixing the escalating costs of wildfire suppression crowding out
funding for forest management.


Currently, Congress provides the Forest Service and other land management
agencies funds to suppress wildfires based on the average cost for fighting
these fires over the past ten years. When the costs for suppressing wildfires
exceed the amount budgeted, the agencies must pay for firefighting with money
allocated for other purposes. This budgetary process within the agencies is
referred to as "fire borrowing." Fire borrowing ultimately means that the Forest
Service and other land management agencies have fewer resources for forest
maintenance, the removal of hazardous fuels, and other practices that prevent
fires from sparking.
The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would end fire borrowing by changing the
budget process for wildfire suppression. Under the act, once the funds budgeted
for wildfire suppression have been exhausted, continuing to fight wildfires will
be paid for like other natural disasters. As a result, the Forest Service and
other land management agencies can use the resources allocated for maintenance
and other practices that prevent wildfires for their intended preventative
purposes.
"Recent wildfires have caused incredible hardship to California's mountain
communities," said Rep. Costa. "What's more, it's estimated that there are over
100 million dead trees in California's forests right now. This is unprecedented,
and is a result of a combination of the effects of a 5-year long drought and an
increasing pace of bark beetle infestation. Our forest managers, as hard as they
have tried, simply cannot do their jobs effectively while arcane Congressional
budget rules divert funds needed for active management of our forests to
combatting wildfires.  It's time to treat wildfires like the natural disaster
they are and stop the never-ending cycle of taking money needed for forest
management. This legislation will do exactly that, in a commonsense way, and I
urge Congress to bring this to the President's desk as rapidly as possible."
The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act of 2017 has 16 original cosponsors, including
Congressman Costa, and has strong bipartisan support. Similar legislation was
also introduced in the 113th and 114th Congresses, and Rep. Costa cosponsored
both of those bills as well.

More wildfires expected as mercury rises

BYLINE: Himalayan news service

LENGTH: 272  words


Kathmandu, February 9: With the onset of summer, incidents of wildfires are
being reported from across the country.

According to UNISDR-Regional South Asia Wildland Fire Network, as many as 14
incidents of wildfire had been reported from across the country today.

"Only a few incidents of wildfire have been reported in the last week, but with
the rise in temperature, incidents of forest fire will increase gradually," said
Coordinator of UNISDR-Regional South Asia Wildland Fire Network Sundar Sharma.

Wildfires destroy thousands of hectares of forest in Nepal annually.

"As temperatures rise, incidents of wildfires will also increase," said Sharma,
adding that normally most number of incidents of wildfire are reported on the
fourth week of April every year.

Wildfires are normally reported in Nepal from mid-February to May in Nepal. On
April 25, 2009, as many as 420 incidents of wildfires were recorded in a single
day, the highest incidents of wildfire recorded in a single day in the country.

With the onset of windy season which usually begins as early as February and
lasts until June, various places across the country, especially in Tarai, have
witnessed a rise in temperatures.

Sharma said since 2009, the government has come up with some positive
interventions to address the growing threat of wildfires in forests and
communities.

The Nepali government has formulated the Forest Policy this year to minimise the
risks and prepare communities against wildfires.

In 2010, the government endorsed the Forest Fire Management Strategy, which
focuses on involving local communities in mitigating the risks related with
forest fires.

Wildfires still a threat despite rain

BYLINE: Angel McCurdy, Northwest Florida Daily News, Fort Walton Beach

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 293 words


Feb. 20--While some states have particular times of the year for wildfires,
Florida officials say every day in the Sunshine State is wildfire season.

Recent rainy weather has kept wildfires at bay, but Brian Goddin, a wildfire
mitigation specialist and public information officer with Florida Fire Service,
said the rain could cause potential problems come warmer weather.

"Realistically, with the excess moisture a lot of this vegetation will grow very
well and bush up, and therefore become fuel for fire," Goddin said. "Once we hit
late spring, early summer, the buildup of the vegetation is likely to cause
problems."

Last year, Florida had more than 3,000 wildfires that burned nearly 68,000
acres. In the last 10 years, more than 1.3 million acres have been burned.

Goddin said Florida has about 3,000 wildfires a year on average.

"There are two types of fire that people should be aware of," Goddin said.
"There are bad fires like wildfires and house fires. Then there are good fires
like a candle on your birthday cake or prescribed burns."

Goddin said one of the best ways to fight wildfires is through prescribed, or
controlled, burns because they help rid the land of vegetation that can feed a
fire.

He added that residents can take precautions at their homes to ensure safety
come drier weather. Goddin advised cleaning out gutters and making certain roofs
are clear of debris. He also suggested ridding yards of unsafe mulch such as
pine straw.

"You have to think like a fire," Goddin said. "Know what will burn and what can
catch fire so you can be safe."

Greenland's largest ever wildfire alarms world's climate scientists;
ENVIRONMENT

BYLINE: Tom Bawden ENVIRONMENT CORRESPONDENT

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 484 words


The largest wildfire Greenland has ever seen has been raging for more than a
week - a development that is particularly striking given that 80 per cent of the
country is covered by thick ice.

Satellite images have shown the wildfire stretching across an area of up to six
square miles - producing a 1.2-mile-high smoke plume in the process - about 90
miles to northeast of the town of Sisimiut. Wildfires are unusual on the icy
island - especially large ones like this - where temperatures rarely reach 10°C,
even in the height of summer.

But Greenland has recorded an unprecedented 40 fires so far this year - more
than double the previous record of 19 set in 2015.

"Wildfires have occurred in the past over Greenland but 2017 is exceptional in
the number of fire detections," Professor Stef Lhermitte, of Delft University in
the Netherlands, said.

Experts believe the surge in the number and size of wildfires is likely to be
due to rising temperatures drying out the peat. As the permafrost melts it
leaves large areas of peat susceptible to fires.

Scientists say it is too early to definitively link the surge in wildfires to
global warming - but many fear it could be the case. And they are watching the
situation closely to see if the blaze represents a new milestone in global
warming or is a one-off event.

Previous landmarks include the world recording its hottest ever temperature for
each of the past three years, Arctic sea ice cover hitting a record winter low
in 2017 and North Pole temperatures being almost 20°C higher than normal last
Christmas.

"The jury is still out on the significance of this. But it is fair to say
scientists find this very unusual and will now be tracking wildfires in
Greenland for increased signs of climate-change impacts," Professor Jessica
McCarty, a wildfire expert from Miami University, said.

"If these types of fires become more common in Greenland in the next three to 10
years, then this will signal a shift in fire regimes. Scientists will then be
able to say with some confidence that 2017 marked a significant turning point
for wildfires near the second largest body of ice in the world."

Professor Marco Tedesco, a polar scientist at Columbia University, said: "We
want to understand the sources of this fire."

Wave of wildfires Soaring temperatures have led to a spate of wildfires in
Portugal this summer.

Last week alone, thousands of firefighters battled more than 60 wildfires as
temperatures pushed up towards 40?C. Some of these fires were still burning last
night, while weather conditions will be "especially favourable for wildfires"
until Sunday, with strong winds and temperatures of up to 39?C, the Portuguese
government warned.

Canada has also suffered badly this year, recording the worst wildfire
destruction for 60 years.

British Columbia bore the brunt, with more than 860 wildfires. An estimated
4,910 sq km have burned to the ground since April.

The Bronco Bulletin: Measures are taken to improve wildfire management

BYLINE: The Ritzville Adams County Journal staff

LENGTH: 483  words


In the middle of fire season, Smokey the Bear's cautious message resonates
through all of us: only YOU can prevent wildfires.

However, fire prevention was an issue long before Smokey ever reminded us it
was. Now more than ever, Congress is working to lessen the impacts of wildfires.

Smokey the Bear is the longest running public service advertising campaign in
American history.

In 1942, the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention Campaign used Walt Disney's
Bambi -- on loan for one year only -- to advertise wildfire prevention.

The campaign's success sparked artist Albert Stahle to create the first poster
depicting Smokey the Bear in 1944.

Smokey the Bear's website explains, "The campaign's original catch phrase was
"Smokey Says -- Care Will Prevent 9 out of 10 Forest Fires."

In 1947 it was changed to "Remember... Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires."

Most recently, in 2001, it was again modified to "Only YOU Can Prevent Wildfires
" in response to a massive outbreak of wildfires in natural areas other than
forests."

The Congressional Research Service, the organization responsible for informing
legislative debates, keeps track of wildfires each year: "Acreage burned during
the 2014 wildfire season was less than half of the 9.3 million acres burned in
2012, which was the third-largest acreage burned annually since 1960."

The annual devastations have peaked Congress' interest, and the newly passed
Resilient Federal Forests Act allows them to take action. The bill, introduced
on June 4, 2015 passed through the House Natural Resources Committee on July 11,
2015.

The act will increase funding towards wildfire suppression.

An article published by the House Committee on Agriculture explains, "The
Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015, H.R. 2647 is a comprehensive bill aimed
at expediting and improving forest management activities in federal forests...
[It addresses] disastrous consequences of catastrophic wildfire, insect and
disease infestations, and other threats to our nation's forests. "This bill
seeks to return resilience to overgrown, fire-prone forested lands."

The Congressional Research Service adds, "Wildfire funding is of concern to
many. This is primarily due to interest in the effectiveness of annual wildfire
appropriations (e.g., whether the funding is allowing agencies to meet wildfire
management targets)."Congress has provided funding for wildfire management
additional to what was granted in the Interior appropriations bill -- usually
for fire suppression-for 7 of the last 10 years including FY[fireyear]2013and
FY2Q14."

They continue, "The proposals would fund wildfire suppression for a select group
of fires theoretically the most extreme fires -- by creating a new adjustment to
the statutory discretionary spending limits."

The Resilient Federal Forests Act will improve wildfire management and
suppression in years to come, making Smokey the Bear's job much easier.

New law protects forests

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. C8

LENGTH: 260 words

DATELINE: REGINA


New wildfire management legislation has arrived in time for the province's
wildfire season, which typically runs from April 1 to Oct. 31.

The Wildfire Act replaces The Prairie and Forest Fires Act, 1982, one of the
oldest pieces of wildfire legislation in Canada. The new act, with the
accompanying wildfire regulations, provides a modern regulatory framework that
ensures public safety, while fostering sustainable economic growth, the Ministry
of the Environment said in a press release Wednesday.

For example, burning permits are no longer required to burn in or within 4.5
kilometres of the provincial forest during the wildfire season, and have been
replaced by a simpler, more flexible burn notification system with an exemption
for small fires.

As well, the new act and regulations clarify responsibility for wildfires within
municipalities, enhance wildfire prevention and preparedness, and provide clear
direction for industrial and commercial operators within the forest, the
ministry said.

The new act will assist in the development of wildfire chapters for the
Saskatchewan Environmental Code, addressing topics including wildfire prevention
and preparedness plans for industrial and commercial operations, and new
buildings and structures where urban and forested areas meet.

Anyone planning to burn in or near the provincial forest can find information
about safe burning and the new notification system at www.saskatchewan.ca/fire
or by calling their local Forest Protection Area office. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2015

Florida: Florida Forest Service Celebrates Smokey Bear's 72nd Birthday

LENGTH: 340  words




 Tallahassee:  Department of Agricuture And Consumer Service, The State of
Florida has issued the following news release:



  Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam H. Putnam and the Florida Forest
Service are today celebrating the 72nd birthday of Smokey Bear, the national
symbol for wildfire prevention since 1944.





 "In honor of Smokey Bear's 72nd birthday, I encourage Floridians and visitors
to remember and take seriously Smokey Bear's call to always be careful with
fire," said Commissioner of Agriculture Adam H. Putnam.



 For generations, the Smokey Bear campaign has been the cornerstone for wildfire
prevention education. Smokey Bear's message, "Only you can prevent wildfires,"
has helped reduce the number of national acres burned by wildfires from
approximately 22 million to 7 million annually. The prevention of wildfires
remains one of the most critical issues affecting the country and state with 70
to 80 percent of Florida's wildfires caused by people



 "Smokey Bear's message is as significant today as it was 72 years ago. Careless
wildfires unnecessarily endanger the lives of citizens and wildland firefighters
alike. They also occupy resources that could otherwise be ready to fight
naturally caused wildfires, such as those caused by lightning," said Jim Karels,
Florida State Forester.



 Escaped debris burns and arson are the top two causes of wildfires in Florida.
Since January, the Florida Forest Service and its partners have responded to
nearly 2,000 wildfires that have burned more than 34,000 acres. Visit
SmokeyBear.com  to take Smokey Bear's wildfire prevention pledge and learn more
about wildfire prevention.



 The Florida Forest Service, a division within the Florida Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services, manages more than one million acres of public
forestland while protecting 26 million acres of homes, forestland and natural
resources from the devastating effects of wildfire.

Washington: Wyden: Congress Needs to Step Up if the White House Won't Work to
Protect Communities from Wildfires

LENGTH: 396  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Ron Wyden has issued the following news
release:

On the heels of the most expensive wildfire season on record, Sen. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore., today slammed the Trump administration for failing to provide aid for
communities in the West and across the country ravaged by wildfires this year.


The administration had committed to releasing a package in the coming weeks to
help recovery efforts from 2017's natural disasters, including major hurricanes
and record-breaking wildfires. Yet the disaster aid request from the White House
to Congress, released today, did not contain a widely supported, permanent
wildfire funding fix, nor any additional aid for communities hit hard by the
record-breaking fire year.
"It is unacceptable the White House fails to recognize the danger wildfires pose
to western communities, essentially leaving us to continue fighting the West's
natural disasters on our own," Wyden said. "Our communities are battling growing
infernos and a broken wildfire budgeting system that shortchanges prevention
funding in a destructive cycle that literally adds fuel to fires. If the White
House refuses to offer aid to wildfire-stricken communities, it's up to Congress
to get off the backbench and put an end to fire borrowing, and this senseless
cycle, for good."
In a letter to Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney earlier
this month, Wyden and Senate Democratic senators called on the administration to
put forward a comprehensive disaster package to fix the government's backwards
system of wildfire funding and provide relief from the onslaught of natural
disasters in recent months.
Wyden has repeatedly urged Congress and the Trump administration to pass the
Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which he introduced with a bipartisan coalition
of western senators to end fire borrowing and protect funding the Forest Service
needs to do wildfire prevention and other forest management work. Their bill
would allow the Forest Service to use funds from disaster funding to pay to
fight remaining wildfires once the agency exceeds its appropriated fire
suppression budget for the year. The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would also
raise the budget cap for the disaster funding so wildfires wouldn't siphon money
away from recovery efforts or require other natural disasters to "compete" with
wildfires for funding.

Help prevent wildfires on the B.C. Day long weekend

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 1218 words


Emergency Management BC

VICTORIA - With B.C. Day around the corner, everyone has a role to play in
helping to prevent wildfires and having a safe, healthy long weekend.

Being aware of the status of parks and highways will help any travel plans go
smoothly.

August is traditionally the most active part of the wildfire season. Given the
number of fires currently burning in the province, along with elevated fire
danger ratings and extremely dry conditions in many parts of the province, the
BC Wildfire Service is urging British Columbians and visitors to remain vigilant
regarding potential fire dangers.

From April 1 through Aug. 1, 2017, the BC Wildfire Service responded to 852
wildfires in B.C., 341 of which were caused by people. Human-caused fires -
e.g., from improperly extinguished campfires, discarded cigarettes and sparking
vehicles - are completely preventable and unnecessarily tie up crucial
firefighting resources that could be used to deal with naturally occurring
wildfires.

Campfire safety and fire-use precautions

The BC Wildfire Service continues to receive reports of illegal campfires.
Campfires and open fires are banned throughout the province, with the exception
of Haida Gwaii and the "Fog Zone" on the west side of Vancouver Island. A map of
the Fog Zone is available online: http://ow.ly/bCJc30caIul Fireworks are banned.

The current open-fire prohibitions do not apply to CSA-rated or ULC-rated
cooking stoves that use gas, propane or briquettes, or to a portable campfire
apparatus that uses briquettes, liquid or gaseous fuel, as long as the height of
the flame is less than 15 centimetres. Local governments may have their own
burning restrictions or bylaws in place, so always check with local authorities
before lighting any fire of any size.

The government's natural resource officers and conservation officers conduct
regular patrols throughout British Columbia, monitoring high-risk activities and
looking out for potential damage. These officers also work closely with BC
Wildfire Service staff to investigate the cause of wildfires and any improper
use of fire when an open burning prohibition is in effect. Patrols will be
stepped up this weekend to educate the public about fire restrictions and issue
violation tickets to people who are not complying with open burning
prohibitions.

To report a wildfire or open-burning violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or
*5555 on a cellphone. To report suspicious activities, environmental damage or a
natural-resource violation, call 1 877 952-RAPP (7277) or *7277 on a cellphone.

Detailed information about current open-fire restrictions is available on the BC
Wildfire Service website: www.gov.bc.ca/wildfirebans

Ensuring proper maintenance on vehicles is also an important step in preventing
potential risks for starting wildfires. Locked brakes, or dragging sway bars or
safety chains on vehicles can create sparks.

Installing spark arrestors on all-terrain vehicles, checking the condition of
mufflers, regularly clearing build-ups of grass or other vegetation from hot
spots on the vehicle, staying on dirt paths and avoiding areas with tall grass
and weeds will all help reduce wildfire risks. It's also important to turn off
propane in recreational equipment at the tank when travelling.

More information on wildfire prevention: www.gov.bc.ca/wildfireprevention

Smoking

The BC Wildfire Service continues to receive reports of improperly discarded
cigarettes. Smokers must dispose of cigarette butts and other smoking material
responsibly, making sure that these materials are completely extinguished.
Smokers who drop lit or smouldering cigarettes or other items could face a $575
fine under the Wildfire Act.

Fines

Anyone found in contravention of an open-burning prohibition may be issued a
violation ticket for $1,150, may be required to pay an administrative penalty of
$10,000 or, if convicted in court, may be fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced
to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire,
the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated
costs.

Health and Wellness

Air quality in B.C. continues to fluctuate due to wildfire activity. Poor air
quality can be harmful to health, especially for children, older adults, and
those with heart and lung conditions. Forest-fire smoke is a complex and dynamic
mixture of gases and small particles that can irritate the respiratory system
and cause systemic inflammation.

Here are some tips to help minimize health effects:

* If you have a chronic condition, have rescue medication on hand at all times
and a plan to follow if your rescue medication cannot bring your condition under
control.

* Look for indoor environments that might be less smoky, such as shopping malls,
community centres and libraries.

* Avoid physical exertion because the amount of smoke you breathe increases as
your breathing rate increases.

* Keep hydrated as it helps your body deal with inflammation.

If you are feeling unwell, you can call 811, a free-of-charge provincial health
information and advice phone line available in British Columbia. If you or a
loved one is experiencing a medical emergency, please call 911.

Know Before You Go - BC Parks

Most provincial parks remain open for recreational and camping activities.
However, due to the serious nature of the current wildfire situation, BC Parks,
in co-ordination with the BC Wildfire Service, has closed numerous parks to
protect public safety.

Prior to closing parks, multiple factors are taken into consideration, such as
weather conditions and forecasts, access routes, the presence of active fires,
and fire-danger ratings. Wildfires are dynamic and circumstances can change
quickly. BC Parks and the BC Wildfire Service assess situations on a daily
basis.

British Columbians and visitors are urged to follow the instructions of BC Parks
staff, BC Wildfire Service officials, the RCMP, conservation officers and other
authorized personnel in the area. See an alphabetical list of B.C. parks and
their status at: www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parks/

Wildfire recovery and prevention still a hot topic for City and CRD

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 523 words


<p>The City of Quesnel and Cariboo Regional District (CRD) are continuing to
commit time and resources to wildfire recovery and prevention.</p>

<p>At the most recent North Cariboo Joint Planning Committee on Mar. 13,
representatives from the City and CRD heard from contractor employees with the
Fraser Basin Council on both topics.</p>

<p>The wildfire recovery update outlined all activities that the sub-regional
wildfire recovery team is focusing on.</p>

<p>Of note was that the wildfire recovery team has advocated for a the hire of a
locally based community wellness coordinator to serve Quesnel and Nazko. The
United Way committed to hiring two coordinators for the North Cariboo region
specifically, the first of whom will begin the job this Monday. </p>

<p>The wellness coordinator will be working with individuals impacted by the
wildfires, helping them access resources to optimize their physical and
emotional health, as well as gathering additional resources and discovering what
more is needed on a long-term basis to serve impacted individuals.</p>

<p>The wildfire recovery team also reported that they are continuing to assess
the impact of the wildfires on urban and rural businesses. They have requested
an extension to the Red Cross' April deadline, to June 2018, as they are finding
many more businesses are now realizing they have been affected by loss of income
due to the wildfires.</p>

<p>The Fraser Basin Council's Cariboo-Chilcotin regional manager Erin Robinson
also presented a proposed Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP) at the
committee meeting, outlining the type of work needed to protect Quesnel and area
from future fires. </p>

<p>The plan, which is available to read online at <a
href="https://www.quesnel.ca/city-hall/major-initiatives/community-wildfire
-protection-plan"
target="_blank">www.quesnel.ca/city-hall/major-initiatives/community-wildfire
-protection-plan</a>, includes recommendations for FireSmart planning and
hand-crew forest fuel management, and is now being reviewed by the Union of BC
Municipalities (UBCM) under its Strategic Wildfire Prevention Initiative. Should
it pass the review, prescriptions will be developed to move prevention
activities forward. </p>

<p>The boundaries of the CWPP project can be seen online, and extend 2km from
the fire protection boundaries of local fire departments in Bouchie Lake, 10
Mile Lake, Barlow Creek, West Fraser and Kersley. The area extends to include
Dragon Mountain and Milburn Mountain, to cover communication towers. </p>

<p>The CRD is looking into fire protection and prevention beyond those
boundaries.</p>

<p>Within the area, the CWPP has identified 2,700 hectares of crown land that
requires fuel management treatment in and around Quesnel. </p>

<p>To that end, a motion was passed at the Joint Planning Committee meeting to
send a letter to the Honourable Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands,
Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development (FLNRORD) to request that the
Ministry take the lead on CWPP activities and that communities receive 100 per
cent of funding from the provincial government's Forest Enhancement Society.</p>

Relief fund aids wildfire recovery

BYLINE: Kelli Hernandez, The Valdosta Daily Times, Ga.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 532 words


Jan. 8--Partners all over the state have joined together and established a
privately-funded Wildfire Relief Fund for those affected by the 2007 wildfire
season and local support has been extended to aid the effort.

During the spring and summer of 2007, Georgia experienced an unprecedented
drought and subsequent period of wildfires, especially in a 21-county area of
Southeast Georgia. Between mid-February and June, a total of 54 wildfires burned
across the area scorching a total of 462,753 acres, almost 31,000 acres of which
burned on private family lands, according to the Georgia Forestry Commission.
Those effects were not lost on the citizens of Lowndes and surrounding counties.

Locally, an associate of Weyerhaeuser had a relative hurt in Waycross after
being struck by an emergency vehicle during the wildfires. In response, the
local industry made a contribution to the Wildfire Relief Fund to support the
group in their efforts.

"We saw this as an opportunity to help the tremendous effort that those folks
are going through right now," Weyerhaeuser Raw Materials/Logistics Manager, Jeff
Wooley, stated.

Partners statewide are working to raise $7 million, which is the amount the GFC
reports it will take to reforest and restore the affected areas, according to
Monte Simpson, fund spokesperson and Weyerhaeuser public affairs manager.

"That's less than $1 from each resident in the state to bring back this area
from the misfortune it experienced last spring," Simpson said in a press
release.

Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle applauded the establishment of the new Wildfire Relief
Fund.

"The 2007 wildfires affected 21 counties in South Georgia and many family forest
farms. Our farms are a key economic engine for our state and we should do all we
can to restore them to the level of production prior to the wildfires," Cagle
stated in a press release. "I am proud of those who are working diligently to
raise needed funds to restore and rebuild the areas affected."

Once funds have been received, the GFC will notify those family forest owners
who are known to have been affected by the wildfires. Landowners will be given
the opportunity to apply for incentive payments from the Wildfire Relief Fund to
reforest their land. GFC foresters will review applications and inspect the
affected lands and reward incentive payments based on need and the amount of
fund available.

Partners of the Wildfire Relief Fund include the Georgia Forestry Association,
Weyerhaeuser, BASF, National Wild Turkey Federation, GFC, Seven Rivers Resource
Conservation and Development Council, Department of Natural Resources, Natural
Resources Conservation Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Anyone interested in becoming a partner should contact Lynn Carter at

New law regulates burning around provincial forest

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 259 words


New wildfire-management legislation has arrived in time for the province's
wildfire season, which typically runs from April 1 to Oct. 31.

The Wildfire Act replaces The Prairie and Forest Fires Act, 1982, one of the
oldest pieces of wildfire legislation in Canada. The new act, with the
accompanying wildfire regulations, provides a modern regulatory framework that
ensures public safety, while fostering sustainable economic growth, the Ministry
of the Environment said in a press release Wednesday.

For example, burning permits are no longer required to burn in or within 4.5
kilometres of the provincial forest during the wildfire season and have been
replaced by a simpler, more flexible burn notification system with an exemption
for small fires.

As well, the new act and regulations clarify responsibility for wildfires within
municipalities, enhance wildfire prevention and preparedness and provide clear
direction for industrial and commercial operators within the forest, the
ministry said.

The new act will assist in the development of wildfire chapters for the
Saskatchewan Environmental Code, addressing topics including wildfire prevention
and preparedness plans for industrial and commercial operations and new
buildings and structures where urban and forested areas meet.

Anyone planning to burn in or near the provincial forest can find information
about safe burning and the new notification system at www.saskatchewan.ca/fire
or by calling their local Forest Protection Area office. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2015

The New York Times's Resident Expert for a World on Fire

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 994 words


The email landed almost as soon as I woke up on Father's Day in Phoenix, where I
work as bureau chief. Bryant Rousseau, an editor on the International desk,
asked if I could help out on a story about the wildfire that killed at least 64
people in Portugal, including many who were trapped inside their cars.

There are certain elements that are common to the narrative of deadly wildfires:
hot and dry weather, overgrown forests and a rushed evacuation, which may be a
result of the fire's ferocity, poor planning or both.

Behind every wildfire, though, is the story of the land that is burning and how
it has been treated over time. In the United States, much of our public forest
land is overgrown because of past policies directing firefighters to put out
every fire just as soon as it starts burning, which eliminates fire's natural
role as janitor of the wild.

But Portugal is another country, on another continent, so my question was, how
is it that the overgrown forest that is burning there got to be that way?

It may sound like an odd specialty to have, but these days being The Times's
resident fire expert is quite useful. Wildfires have become more common and more
ferocious, in part because of climate change, a priority in our report.

When my colleague Matt Richtel reached out to me early in March 2016 to pick my
brain on the best way to talk about wildfires in the context of global warming,
I knew the story to tell, one I had heard from scientists and firefighters
numerous times: Fires, once confined to a season, now burn year round. The
wildfires that broke out that month in Alaska and Northern Arizona, places that
are usually cold and covered in snow in the winter, illustrate this point.

Wildfires are common in the late spring and early summer in the Southwest, when
it is hot and dry, and also when lightning from the first monsoon storms strikes
-- and ignites -- the parched ground. On the day the fire in Portugal turned
deadly, there were at least 13 wildfires burning in Arizona. I had my eye on
them, knowing what it takes for a wildfire to become news.

There are many differences between structure fires (like the recent one in
London) and wildfires, and the people who fight them need entirely different
training and skills. While water extinguishes flames burning a building, trails
that firefighters carve in the wild -- barren strips of land devoid of anything
that burns -- stop a wildfire.

That is a basic distinction but an important one. I learned about it while
covering a wildfire that killed 19 firefighters in Yarnell, Ariz., in 2013. And
it got me wanting to learn more, especially about how climate influences fire
behavior.

I wrote a book about the Arizona wildfire, and while researching it I talked to
a lot of scientists who study the relationship between fire and climate. I took
the basic training course at the Arizona Wildfire and Incident Management
Academy, where I learned to cut fire line, read the weather and work in teams.

The academy is also where I learned the right questions to ask. Last year, as a
wildfire destroyed the community of Fort McMurray, in Canada, a lot of people
wondered why firefighters could not stop the flames. It is a common and
understandable question, since we are used to watching firefighters put out
building fires within hours.

But wildfires are a different beast, and fighting them is a game of chess. It
requires adaptability and patience, as does reporting on firefighting. The
littlest change in weather -- say, wind that starts blowing in a different
direction -- forces firefighters to reassess their risks and redefine their
strategies, and quickly.

The point I made in the story I wrote about the Fort McMurray fire was that some
wildfires grow so big and so dangerous that they simply cannot be stopped.

Fighting wildfires is backbreaking work: Firefighters work for 14 days straight,
16 hours a day, pounding the earth on rocky, steep terrain, all while carrying
50 pounds of gear on their backs. They hike for miles just to get to where they
need to start digging, a place that is usually so far away and so treacherous
that reporters are rarely allowed by their side. That is why we hardly see these
firefighters on the evening news.

Firefighters are plagued by exhaustion. They are pressured by residents and
local elected officials who want them to focus on saving homes, even if that
puts their lives at greater risk. And though wildfires have changed, they are
still fighting them in much the same way they have for decades.

That is a global reality, but it is only part of the story. The land is another
part. The fire in Portugal showed the consequences of land abandonment over time
because of changes to the social and economic order in Europe. Small farmers
left rural areas for cities. Their land, which used to be heavily grazed and
cultivated, was left behind with no one to care for it. Ultimately, officials
said the wildfire appeared to have been arson, not an uncommon cause for
wildfires, which are mostly caused by humans, intentionally or otherwise.

The Times does not have a fire beat, but I guess I'm the closest thing to a fire
reporter. At home, I have my own fire-resistant shirt and pants, and the boots
required to fight wildfires. In 2014, I passed a physical test that is known as
a pack test -- a three-mile hike in under 45 minutes with 45 pounds on my back.
It is a requirement for anyone who wants to join a wildland firefighting crew.

I don't think my family would have been thrilled if I had quit my job to go
fight wildfires, so I let my certification lapse. And, to be perfectly honest,
I'd rather ride waves than battle flames: The day after I worked on the story
about the Portugal fire, I escaped to Maui. But if any of the editors or
reporters at The Times need help on a wildfire story, I'll be glad to help out.

This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in
print.

Wildfires hurting tourism in B.C., including areas spared scorching

BYLINE: Patrick Johnston, Calgary Herald

SECTION: CITY; Pg. A6

LENGTH: 653 words


B.C.'s official tourism agency wants travellers to know that even with wildfires
burning in some regions, the province is still open for visitors.

Destination B.C.'s vice-president of global marketing, Maya Lange, said Thursday
that while many business in the B.C. Interior have been directly affected by
wildfires, there are many which haven't, but are still seeing a drop in
visitors. "B.C. is open to explore," she said Thursday.

"Our thoughts are with all of those impacted and our first priority is ensuring
people are safe and know where to find information," she said.

Many vacation destinations have had to close because of the wildfire situation.

"We are extremely proud of the business owners in the affected areas. They are
resourceful, innovative and resilient," and have helped feed and house emergency
personnel fighting wildfires this summer as well as care for evacuees and
stranded travellers, she added.

Elsewhere, "there are businesses that been impacted because of access issues,"
she said.

But businesses in areas not affected by wildfires, like the Thompson-Okanagan
area or the Kootenays, have also seen a drop in visitors, especially by people
who live in B.C. and Alberta.

Many of those cancellations, Lange said, have been because of misinformation
about the wildfire or the air quality situation. She suggested travellers check
hellobc.com/wildfire for up-to-date information. Drivers should check DriveBC.ca
for the latest road conditions. The B.C. Wildfire Service's website is also
useful.

Destination B.C. is stepping up efforts to get the word out to locals and to
potential visitors from further afield that "we're still open."

"We are encouraging businesses in non-impacted areas to contact their customers
who have reservations to share updates," she said.

A big push is being made to connect with potential travellers in B.C. and
Alberta through both traditional means - newspapers and billboards, for instance
- and through social media.

On the other hand, there has been a noted surge in tourism in the coastal parts
of the province, especially on Vancouver Island, Lange said.

And Destination B.C. is adding to their traditional push to promote shoulder
season travel.

"We will ensure that impacted areas receive additional marketing support once it
is safe to visit again and capacity has been established," she said.

There are 138 fires currently burning across the province, the B.C. Wildfire
Service said. There have been 1,031 fires since the beginning of the 2017 fire
season in April, which have burned more than 9,000 square kilometres of land.

That is now the biggest fire season since records were first kept in the early
1950s.

More than $321 million has been spent by the wildfire service this year. Between
firefighters from the wildfire service, personnel from other provinces and
countries and local private contractors, there are over 4,000 people currently
involved in fighting fires.

August is traditionally the height of the B.C. wildfire season. The wildfire
service's chief fire information officer, Kevin Skrepnek, said there was no
reason to think anything was going to change in the near future.

"Certainly not done this season by any stretch of the imagination," he said.
"Generally warm and dry conditions are going to be the order of the day, going
forward really."

But fire activity, especially on the biggest fires - the Hanceville/Riske Creek
fire west of Williams Lake and the Elephant Hill fire northeast of Cache Creek -
had proved to be lower mid-week versus last weekend.

"That's down to a shift in the weather and hard work happening."

Even so, the extended forecast suggested very little rain on the way in coming
weeks, he said.

Emergency Management B.C. said the current state of emergency, set to expire
Friday, was being reviewed for possible extension. pjohnston@postmedia.com

USAA Offers Insurance Discounts for Living in Firewise Communities

LENGTH: 504  words


Oct. 6 -- USAA members now can save money on their homeowners insurance premiums
by living within the boundaries of a recognized Firewise Communities/USA
program. Currently, the discounts are available to eligible members in
California, Colorado and Texas, three states prone to wildfire activity.

"Wildfire season is well underway, and we want to educate the public and our
members on ways to prepare for a wildfire," says Jim Salek, vice president of
underwriting programs and loss prevention at USAA. "It is important that
individual homeowners take action to reduce the risks of wildfires. However,
this is a team effort, and an entire community can benefit when it gets behind
fire prevention efforts. We hope the Firewise discount gives communities the
incentive to take action."

USAA was the first major national insurance provider to offer such discounts to
members living in Firewise Communities and has teamed up with Firewise to
determine if a home is located in a recognized community. The discount is then
automatically applied to USAA members who live in that community*. The Firewise
website has a list of the recognized communities and information on how to take
action to get communities started on the recognition process.

While the program is currently limited, USAA intends to pursue this discount for
its members living in other states with significant wildfire risks. As of June
30, the discount is automatically applied only to new homeowners policies and
rental property insurance policies, for those who own and rent out property,
issued or renewed in California, Colorado and Texas.

USAA also has expanded its direct efforts to help members threatened by an
active wildfire. In 14 wildfire-prone states, USAA offers all eligible members
enrollment in the Wildfire Response Program. The program, conducted with
Wildfire Defense Systems, an association of professional wild land firefighters,
attempts to help eligible members protect their homes in the event of an active
wildfire. WDS monitors wildfire activity and, working with the onsite incident
commander, takes proactive measures, when feasible, to help protect a member's
home, such as closing windows and doors, clearing debris and moving other
flammable materials away from the home.

USAA offers other wildfire-related products and services to its members,
including:

* A property risk assessment tool on usaa.com, which allows members to input
their address to see if their home is at risk for wildfire or storm surge and
tells them how they can reduce the risk of damage.

* WDSPro App, a free app that gives tips and advice on how to reduce wildfire
risk and helps homeowners complete a property wildfire assessment in less than
20 minutes. On-screen directions cue users to take photos around the outside of
their home to capture key information about their property and surroundings. The
information and photos are submitted to a professional fire risk analyst for
recommendations on how to better protect the home against wildfires.

Hot forecast fules wildfire concerns

BYLINE: Sheri Regnier

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 770 words


With temperatures expected to hit 40 C (104 Fahrenheit) this week and zero per
cent chance of rain, regional firefighters are reminding all Trail and Greater
Area residents that there is to be no backyard burning, period.

One West Trail person learned firsthand just how serious this message is after
he/she received a $1,150 citation last week.

Kootenay Boundary Regional Fire Rescue and a Conservation Officer responded to a
burn complaint in the city's west side just after 7 p.m. last Thursday.

"Upon arrival, members found the occupant to have a fire in a burn
barrel,"confirmed Grant Tyson, the department's operations captain. "The home
owner was fined $1,150 ... regional fire rescue would like to remind everyone,
no burning is allowed."

Campfires, banned in the Southeast Fire Centre since July 7, can now be reported
to the RAPP (Report All Poachers and Polluters) phone line at 1.877.952.7277.

Tyson added, "If there is enough evidence of a fire, the people responsible can
face a significant fine."

Fire Chief Dan Derby says the department is well prepared for emergency
situations, however the ongoing hot and dry conditions are worrisome.

"Following the weather is key to understanding wildfire response and the rate of
spread that can be anticipated by a wildfire," Derby told the Trail Times . "The
weather forecast going into (this) week is the same, and will continue with even
hotter temperatures, that's concerning."

As part of heightened alert across the province, Derby says the department
participates in daily briefings with EMBC (Emergency Management BC) and the BC
Wildfire Service to discuss weather and the current fire situation, as well as
preparedness and planning activities.

Well in advance of the season, firefighters complete annual wildfire refresher
training, train with the BC Wildfire Service, and EOC (Emergency Operations
Centre) staff are trained to support responses to wildfires.

"Additionally, we track our paid-on-call firefighter availability across our six
fire halls to understand availability when we are in high and extreme fire
danger rating," said Derby.

"We have specialized equipment for wildfire response, pumps, hoses, bladders,
structure protection unit for sprinkler protection of homes."

Derby reminds locals to keep up-to-date on FireSmart tips and PreparedBC
guidelines for household preparedness. The resources can be viewed on the RDKB
website , or in pamphlet-form at government agency offices.

The Southeast Fire Centre has responded to 194 wildfires to date, the most
recent being one human-caused and one lighting-caused fire since Sunday.

Locally, the largest active fire is located about 10 kilometres (km) south of
Harrop and Procter on the West Arm of Kootenay Lake, and has been burning for
five days.

"BC Wildfire Service personnel are continuing to monitor and develop control
strategies for the 80-hectare Harrop Creek wildfire," said Fire Information
Officer John Boivin in Monday update.

"The fire, which has been burning since July 27, poses no threat to any
communities or infrastructure at this time and is burning at an elevation of
2,000 metres."

Steep and rocky terrain impeded action by air tankers and initial attack crews,
however, a heavy-lift helicopter has now been dispatched to support local
efforts.

"The BC Wildfire Service reminds the public that campfires are prohibited
throughout the Southeast Fire Centre," Boivin said. "And urges the public to
abide by these restrictions to reduce the number of human-caused wildfires,
which can divert critical resources from naturally occurring wildfires."

Other active wildfires on Monday included:

· The Desmund Creek wildfire, one km from the north edge of Kokanee Glacier
Park, covers about 2.5 hectares. Three BC Wildfire Service personnel were on
site with the support of three aircraft.

· The Mat Creek wildfire, northeast of Goat Range Park and seven km southwest of
Highway 31, covers about 0.1 hectares. A four-person crew was working on the
fire.

· The 39-hectare Ward-Bloom fire, about 34 km southwest of Baynes Lake just
north of the U.S.A. border, experienced no significant growth overnight and had
35 personnel on site, supported by five pieces of heavy equipment.

· A 20-hectare fire at Healy Creek was burning about 11 kilometres northeast of
Highway 31 and about 15 kilometres west of Duncan Lake. Due to location, the
fire was only being monitored. This type of fire-management strategy is called
"modified response" and means that BC Wildfire Service personnel are monitoring
the fire's activity to ensure the fire remains within specific parameters and
meets land-management guidelines.

State not at highest fire risk, study says

BYLINE: RICHARD MIZE, Real Estate Editor

Oklahoma has zero homes at "very high risk" for wildfires, and just 80 at "high
risk," the lowest among 13 Western states studied in a new report for the
insurance industry - statistically speaking.

Santa Ana, Calif.-based property information-analytics firm CoreLogic released
its first Wildfire Hazard Risk Report this week. It identified 740,000
residences at high or very high risk for wildfire damage at an estimated value
of $136 billion.

The study found 57,385 homes in Oklahoma at moderate risk and 110,153 homes at
low risk for wildfire damage.

CoreLogic estimated the value of homes at high risk at $6.8 million, moderate
risk at $5.6 billion, and low risk at $10.8 billion.

Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner John Doak was on the road Tuesday and not
available for an interview, spokesman Brian King said.

Oklahoma burning

Oklahoma has seen 150,000 acres burn and lost some 600 homes to wildfire this
year alone, CoreLogic noted, quoting figures from the National Interagency Fire
Center in Boise, Idaho.

Nonetheless, the firm counted zero Oklahoma homes at "very high risk" and just
80 at "high risk" based on the way it categorizes urban and agricultural
settings. The lack of natural fuels in both urban and agricultural landscapes
gives them "low wildfire risk," the firm said.

However, CoreLogic also developed wildfire risk scores based on a combination of
risk inside individual property boundaries and their distance from higher
wildfire risk zones. Scores range from 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating
"increased opportunity of wildfire."

Under its scoring system, CoreLogic counted 1,077,998 homes ranked 1-50 and
valued at $95.5 billion; 707 homes ranked 51-60 and valued at $52.5 million;
1,007 homes ranked 61-80 and valued at $72.3 million; and 381 homes ranked
81-100 and valued at $28.2 million.

Developed wild lands

"Homes located within a city boundary are not safe from the threat of wildfire
destruction. In fact, the unprecedented growth of urban areas over the past 50
years has generally increased the likelihood homes will be damaged by wildfire
activity," CoreLogic's Howard Botts said in a news release. "As residential
development has expanded into formerly undeveloped wild lands, the transitional
area between the two, known as the wildfire urban interface, has become
exceptionally vulnerable to wildfire."

Some 40 percent of homes in the U.S. are in such transitional areas, Botts said,
"and windblown embers are capable of igniting homes located hundreds or even
thousands of feet away from an actual fire."

Despite the losses and the eruption of widespread fires the past few years,
CoreLogic noted that Oklahoma isn't known for significant numbers of wildfires.

Drought and wind

Drought and high winds, however, are creating risk here that can't be ignored,
according to the firm, which studied Oklahoma, Arizona, California, Colorado,
Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Wyoming and Washington.

The combination of drought and wind in Oklahoma "underscores the importance of
evaluating wildfire risk in areas with less active histories that tend to be
overlooked," CoreLogic said in the report, dated Aug. 23. "It is as yet unknown
what the total amount of insured losses will be, but given the extent and
extreme nature of the current fires, the 2012 wildfires in Oklahoma may well be
the worst in state history."

Incidentally, CoreLogic's study period ended the day after the Federal Emergency
Management Agency approved assistance for homeowners in Creek County but did not
extend aid to homeowners in Oklahoma, Cleveland and Payne counties. Wildfires
destroyed hundreds of homes in those areas July 28-Aug. 14.

Doak called the rejections "bureaucratic" and "cruel" and noted that 227 of the
destroyed homes were in the counties where aid was denied. Gov. Mary Fallin
formally appealed FEMA's decision last Thursday.

Be prepared

"Firefighters throughout our state have done a tremendous job protecting as many
homes as possible," Doak said Tuesday in a prepared statement. "Still, the last
several weeks have been very difficult in terms of wildfires. I've seen the
hardest-hit areas firsthand. With most of our state still in 'extreme' or
'exceptional' drought conditions, all Oklahomans must continue to be prepared
for wildfires and learn how to protect themselves through Firewise and other
educational programs."

Understanding wildfire risk is important for lessening the impact of disaster,
Botts said.

"Accurately identifying risk levels, even in areas where wildfire activity has
historically been low, is imperative to mitigating the potentially devastating
effect of fires to property and on human life," Botts said.

Arizona plans wildfire awareness campaign

BYLINE: The Camp Verde Journal staff

Arizona is a wildfire state, which is another way of saying the state has a
history of destructive wildfires. In the past five years alone, large wildfires
have burned more than 850,000 acres and caused hundreds of of millions of
dollars in damages.

While there is no way of knowing where or when the next big wildfire will spark,
there are scientifically-proven ways to protect lives and property in the whole
community.

"It's hard to exaggerate the threat of wildfire in Arizona or the importance of
preparing for them," said Wendy Smith-Reeve, deputy director for the Arizona
Department of Emergency and Military Affairs. "Wildfires can't be predicted or
always prevented, but home and business owners can take steps to mitigate the
threat of wildfires to themselves, firefighters and their property."

Wildfire mitigation is the focus of a new public service announcement campaign
from DEMA titled Have Their Backs. The statewide campaign will run April through
June and includes radio and television spots in English and Spanish, and
billboards in communities that have experienced large wildfires like Sierra
Vista, Heber-Overgaard and Prescott.

The radio and television spots and billboard ask Arizonans to "have the backs"
of wild land firefighters and to begin to "live Fire wise" by making simple home
improvements to protect your investment.

"Wild land firefighters risk their health and safety every time they go out on
the line," said Smith-Reeve. "One way people can honor firefighters' public
service is to live Fire wise."

Historically, wildfire season in Arizona picks up in May. Last year, the Slide
Fire burned more than 21,200 acres in the area of Oak Creek Canyon. While May is
four short weeks away, there is still enough time to prepare for wildfire by
clearing debris from gutters and creating defensible space around properties.

The Fire wise Communities Program is a national fire prevention and mitigation
campaign that teaches people how to adapt to living with wildfire and encourage
neighbors to work together and take action now to prevent losses. The National
Fire Protection Association manages the Fire wise Communities program, which is
administered in Arizona by the State Forestry Division. Information is available
at the Fire wise website.

Washington: Heinrich Provides Online Resources To Help New Mexicans Prepare For
Wildfire Season

LENGTH: 333  words




Washington: Office of the Senator Martin Heinrich has issued the following news
release:

With wildfire season underway, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) is helping
New Mexicans prepare and stay safe with the Wildfire Preparedness & Prevention
Resource Center that provides information on how to protect communities from the
devastating effects of wildfires. The online resource center includes active
wildfire information, prevention and safety tips, resources for businesses, and
more.


Senator Heinrich also released a 30-second public service announcement (PSA) to
help spread the word about how to stay safe throughout the fire season.
    ONLINE - Wildfire Preparedness & Prevention Resource Center
     TV PSA - Helping New Mexicans Prepare For Wildfire Season
     RADIO PSA - Helping New Mexicans Prepare For Wildfire Season
"We must all do our part to prevent unintended fires, and learning about
wildfire danger and being prepared is the first step," said Senator Heinrich.
"These resources and tips aim to provide New Mexicans with the information they
need to reduce the threat of fires to their homes, communities, and the
surrounding forests."
As a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senator
Heinrich is a leading advocate for wildfire funding reform and improvements to
catastrophic wildfire prevention programs in New Mexico, including hazardous
fuel reduction, stewardship contracting, and watershed restoration. Earlier this
year, Senator Heinrich cosponsored the Stewardship End Result Contracting
Improvement Act to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires and make it easier
for federal land managers and businesses to partner on long-term, large-scale
forest treatment. Senator Heinrich also backs legislation that would treat the
largest fires -- roughly 1 percent of annual fires -- as natural disasters and
fund firefighting efforts from a disaster account similar to the one that funds
hurricane and other natural disaster relief efforts.

EDITORIAL: Take care to avoid wildfires

SECTION: COMMENTARY

April 24--It's a reminder that even though this is the time of year for April
showers (and snow flurries), we still need to be very cognizant of the dangers
of wildfires.

According to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, most of the state's
wildfires occur during the months of April, May and June. The week of April
19-25 is Wildfire Prevention Week, a time when the DNR reminds the public about
the dangers of wildfires.

"One out of three wildfires in Michigan is started by someone who did not take
proper precautions or obtain a burn permit before burning yard debris," said Dan
Laux, DNR fire prevention specialist. "Many people look outside and think the
snow and spring rains have taken the edge off the wildfire danger, but that's
not the case. The dried leaves, needles and brown grass from last year are still
there.

"When the weather is warm, folks want to get out and clean up their yards," he
continued. "They don't realize that all it takes is one strong wind gust
catching an ember to ignite a wildfire."

In addition to obtaining a burn permit, the DNR recommends people take the
following steps to help prevent wildfires:

--Pay attention to the fire danger in your area. Don't burn debris when
conditions are dry or windy. Unsafe burning of leaves, brush and other debris is
a main cause of wildfires.

--Consider composting or mulching yard debris rather than burning it.

--Clear away flammable material surrounding the fire so it won't creep into dry
vegetation.

--Keep campfires small, and do not leave before they are fully extinguished.

--Be sure to douse fires with plenty of water, stir, and add more water until
everything is wet.

--Do not cover a campfire with soil; it may simply smolder before coming back to
life.

--Embers can reignite. Make sure they are out completely.

Fortunately, the two local blazes were quickly extinguished, thanks to fast
action taken by area fire departments. Still, the fact that these fires occurred
in the first place are a sobering reminder that we all need to take extra
precautions each time we consider starting a fire.

Wildfires affect 35 districts

LENGTH: 523 words

DATELINE: KATHMANDU


KATHMANDU, April 14 -- Wildfires engulfed forests in as many as 37 districts of
Nepal by Saturday, reported the International Center for Integrated Mountain
Development (ICIMOD).

Wildfires, which were restricted to mostly Tarai districts until a few days ago,
spread not only in hills but also in mountain districts like Humla and
Solukhumbu on Saturday. Wildfires engulfed forests in protected areas like
Chitwan National Park (CNP) and Banke National Park. ICIMOD reported a forest
fire in Lelep VDC-3 of Taplejung district, which forms part of Kanchanjungha
Conservation Area, too.

According to ICIMOD, which uses satellite images to report forest fires,
altogether 149 wildfires were detected in different parts of the country on
Saturday, which is one of highest numbers of forest fires detected by NASA
satellites this year.

"Saturday turned out to be the worst day of this fire season," said Sundar
Prasad Sharma, Coordinator of Regional South Asia Wildland Fire Network
(RSAWFN). "However, in the days to come, more forest fires can affect more
districts."

According to the Nepal Forest Fire Management Chapter (NFMC) of the RSAWFN, more
than two wildfires were detected in districts like Makawanpur, Sindhuli,
Nawalparasi, Chitwan, Udayapur, Banke, Kapilvastu, Kavre, Khotang, Solukhumbu,
Lalitpur, Dang, Tanahun and Morang.

In some Tarai districts like Banke and Chitwan, wildfires have gone out of
control of local communities and forest authorities. Especially in forests along
the Chure range, authorities and local people have failed to initiate any
efforts to fight wildfires.

"Several wildfires are raging through forests of the Chure area of Banke for the
last two weeks," said Tularam Khatri, Banke district secretary of Federation of
Community Forest Users' Group (FECOFUN). "But, neither we nor forest authorities
have been able to reach fire-affected areas of the Chure range."

According to Khatri, Community Forest Users' Groups (CFUGs) have somehow managed
to control wildfires in their areas so far. "Apart from the Chure area, it is
the forests in the Banke National Park (BNP) area that have been worst affected
by wildfires," said Khatri. "The authorities are not active to douse wildfires
in the park area. But, they do not even allow the locals to enter the core area
of the BNP for the purpose."

Sharma, of the RSAWFN, stressed the need for deploying rapid response teams to
fight wildfires effectively. "Wildfires are chronic in this season," said he.
"What we need is strong teams to contain forest fires. The Nepal Army (NA)'s new
directorate, which was formed to integrate former Maoist combatants, can be used
as a force to fight forest fires."

"Such a team cannot be developed overnight," said Sharma. "For the time being,
the government should make people, especially those living near forests, careful
about handling wildfires. Sending children to look after cattle in forest area
can be too risky this time around." Published by HT Syndication with permission

Washington: Schrader Applauds Attention Given to Wildfires, Says There's More to
Be Done

LENGTH: 624  words



Washington: Office of the MP Kurt Schrader has issued the following news
release:

The House Committee on Natural Resources held a hearing today titled "Exploring
Solutions to Reduce Risks of Catastrophic Wildfire and Improve Resiliency of
National Forests," focused on finding solutions to reduce fire suppression costs
along with the need to improve forest management practices. Since coming into
federal office, Congressman Kurt Schrader (OR-5) has made a priority of working
to fix our broken forest management system and the resulting destruction from
preventable wildfires.


"I thank Chairman Bishop and the Nature Resources Committee for holding this
hearing today and giving serious thought and consideration to the problems we've
been fighting to fix for years to prevent these natural disasters in the west,"
said Rep. Schrader.  "While the southeast captured the national attention this
summer with massive hurricanes and tropical storms, out west we've witnessed one
of the worst wildfire seasons in history. Because of the way we currently
budget, USFS and BLM are forced to exhaust over half their funds on fighting
fires rather than on preventing them. The system is broken.  We need forest
management reforms and we need them now. Mismanagement has left our forests
susceptible to insects and disease and ripe for catastrophic wildfires. We need
to fix the way we manage our forests so that we're curbing the cost and
destruction of these fires each year rather than remaining in this endless loop
of catch-up. I hope we can continue this bipartisan conversation and make real
changes to finally put an end to this vicious cycle."
[VIDEO]: In response to the Eagle Creek fire in Portland this month, Congressman
Schrader took to the House floor to call for better forest management.
Earlier this year, the Congressman reintroduced his bipartisan Wildfire Disaster
Funding Act, alongside Congressman Mike Simpson (R-ID), to fix the current
budgeting process for wildfires. In recent years, Congress has budgeted for
wildfire suppression by appropriating money according to the average cost for
wildfires over the past ten years, known as the "ten-year average."  When costs
exceed an agency's fire budget, that agency is forced to borrow from non-fire
accounts to pay for fire suppression. This practice is known as
"fire-borrowing." Fire borrowing was intended to be an extraordinary measure to
help in bad wildfire years. However, this practice has become the norm and not
the exception, which has caused wildfire costs to increase. According to the
Forest Service, wildfire costs were 56% of their total budget in 2016. In 1995,
the Forest Service spent only 16% of their total budget fighting wildfires. By
2025, that number could increase to nearly 70% if nothing is done to fix the
budgeting process. The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would end fire borrowing by
treating wildfires like other natural disasters when wildfire suppression costs
are exhausted.
And in June, Congressman Schrader's bipartisan bill to provide utility companies
the ability to rapidly remove hazardous vegetation by receiving pre-approval
from the Forest Service passed overwhelmingly in the House. Under current law,
even where trees, plants and other vegetation are already in contact with
electric transmission lines, it can take months for Forest Service to approve
the remove of the hazardous vegetation from the transmission lines rights of
way. This creates a dangerous environment, significantly increasing the
likelihood of blackouts and forest fires. Congressman Schrader bill, which
initially passed out of the Natural Resources Committee, will streamline the
removal of these hazardous plants, decreasing the likelihood of forest fires.

FIGHTING WILDFIRES & PREVENTING THEM

BYLINE: ADAM PUTNAM

SECTION: NATIONAL; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 631 words


In every corner of our state, severe drought conditions have made Florida a
tinderbox.

Roughly 100 wildfires are burning about 75,000 acres, and our Florida Forest
Service wildland firefighters are working side by side with partner agencies to
battle these fires and protect life, property and wildlife. On Friday, Collier
County had to evacuate approximately 7,000 homes due to a massive wildfire.
We've not seen fire conditions this bad since 2011, and we have wildfires
burning from the state line to Miami.

Current conditions conjure memories of one of the worst years on record - 1998,
when at one time I-4, I-75 and I-10 were closed at the same time, Disney World
was closed, the Pepsi 400 was postponed and an entire county, Flagler County,
was evacuated. In 2017 so far, more than 130,000 acres have burned due to
wildfires. Many homes have been saved, but some have been lost.

My grandfather used to say, "Extremes beget extremes." Some of the wettest El
Nino cycles that we have are followed by the driest conditions that are ripe for
wildfire. These tough drought conditions are worsened by the abundance of
undergrowth-brush and weeds-that grows and thrives due to the heavy rainfall the
prior year. With dry conditions, all of it turns into kindling that fuels large
and swiftly moving wildfires, whether caused by people or nature.

Recently, I asked Gov. Rick Scott to issue an executive order to enable us to
use all available resources to combat these wildfires. National Guard UH-60
Blackhawk helicopters are assisting our other aircraft fighting these wildfires.
One of the most concerning aspects of these conditions is the last time an
emergency order was issued in 2011, it was mid June. June is typically the peak
of wildfire season, so it's a very serious situation that it's even earlier in
the year that we're seeing such extreme conditions.

Unfortunately, the two most common causes of wildfire are people. The leading
cause of wildfire is human carelessness, such as allowing a debris pile to grow
out of control or a spark from an intentional fire to land on dry land and start
a wildfire. The second leading cause is arson. We've seen a 70 percent increase
in arson cases this year compared to last year, with 240 cases so far.

Education and awareness are important components of preventing wildfires.
Residents should obey county burn bans, which can be found on
FreshFromFlorida.com. They can also track fire conditions on the website and
learn how to create defensible spaces around their homes. Most importantly, if
evacuation orders are given, residents and visitors should heed those warnings
and keep themselves and their loved ones safe.

Combatting wildfires is truly a partnership. When we recently had a fire on St.
George Island, our Florida Forest Service firefighters were there cutting fire
lines, bringing down the intensity of the flames, while the local structural
firefighters were up against the houses, making sure they were the last line of
defense to protect those homes. As a result, no homes were lost in that fire.

We recently had a firefighter overtaken by flames in his bulldozer in
Okeechobee, and Okeechobee County Fire and Rescue were already on the scene and
assisted in getting him out safely. Thanks to their swift rescue efforts, our
firefighter is safe and in good health. The camaraderie of the firefighting
service is extraordinary, and we should all be proud of them.

The Florida Forest Service will continue to work around the clock to protect
residents and visitors, property and wildlife from fire. And I encourage all
Floridians to do their part to help prevent wildfires and report any suspected
cases of arson by calling local authorities. May God bless our firefighters.

Adam Putnam is Florida's commissioner of agriculture.

Washington: Wyden, Senate Democrats Call for Permanent Wildfire Funding Fix,
Comprehensive Disaster Relief in Third Disaster Aid Bill

LENGTH: 741  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Ron Wyden has issued the following news
release:

Following the most expensive wildfire season on record, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,
and Senate Democrats called on the Trump administration to put forward a
comprehensive package to fix the government's backwards system of wildfire
funding and provide relief from the onslaught of natural disasters in recent
months. The administration has committed to releasing a disaster aid package in
the coming weeks.


In a letter to Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, Wyden and
Senate Democratic senators outlined what must be included in a comprehensive
package that would allow adequate investment in technology, conservation and
infrastructure that will mitigate further damage in future disasters and make
our communities more resilient. The senators called for a permanent fix to fire
borrowing, which would protect funding for forest health work that's been shown
to reduce the severity of severe wildfires.
"Natural disasters have pummeled communities in every corner of our country this
year," Wyden said. "Year after year, the broken wildfire budgeting system
shortchanges prevention funding, literally adding fuel to fires. Putting an end
to fire borrowing would at long last allow America to get ahead of the West's
natural disasters - wildfires. I am calling on the administration to respond now
to this crisis by stopping this senseless cycle for good."
In October, the Senate passed a $36.5 billion emergency supplemental that
contained $18.7 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
Disaster Relief Fund, $16 billion for National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
debt forgiveness, $1.27 billion for nutrition assistance for Puerto Rico, and
$576.5 million to combat wildfires.
That funding allowed the U.S. Forest Service to repay funds transferred - or
"fire borrowed" - from other forest management accounts from which the agency
needed to borrow in order to put out fires during another record-breaking
wildfire season. However, that bill lacked a long-term solution to the broken
system of wildfire funding, which continues to force agencies to rob funds from
fire prevention funding to put out fires.
Wyden has repeatedly urged Congress and the Trump administration to pass the
Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which they introduced with a bipartisan coalition
of western senators to end fire borrowing by allowing the Forest Service to pay
to fight wildfires similar to how responses to other natural disasters are
handled.
Under the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, once agencies exceed their appropriated
fire suppression budgets, they would be able to access disaster funding to pay
to put out the remaining fires. Removing additional suppression costs from the
regular budgets of federal agencies stops the agencies from fire borrowing from
other forest management accounts, protecting that money for other beneficial
prevention and management activities. The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would
raise the budget cap for the disaster funding so wildfires wouldn't siphon money
away from recovery efforts or require other natural disasters to "compete" with
wildfires for funding.
Wildfires burned almost nine million acres of land across the West this year,
according to the National Interagency Fire Center. This year dozens of lives
have been lost to wildfire, thousands of residents have been forced to evacuate
from their homes, and the U.S. Forest Service spent $2.41 billion in fiscal year
2017 to put out fires. The agency had to borrow $576.5 million to cover the
costs of fire suppression through the end of the year, and yet fires continue to
burn into fiscal year 2018.
In addition to Wyden, senators who signed the letter include: Senate Minority
Leader Chuck Schumer, Senators Pat Leahy, D-Vt., Bill Nelson, D-Fla., Patty
Murray, D-Wash., Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., Thomas Carper, D-Del., Bernie Sanders,

Spike in Alaska wildfires is worsening global warming, US says;
Report from US Geological Survey says northern wildfires must now be seen as
significant driver of climate change, not just a side-effect

The devastating rise in Alaska's wildfires is making global warming even worse
than scientists expected, US government researchers said on Wednesday.

The sharp spike in Alaska's wildfires, where more than 5 million acres burned
last year, are destroying a main buffer against climate change: the carbon-rich
boreal forests, tundra and permafrost that have served as an enormous carbon
sink.

Northern wildfires must now be recognised as a  significant driver of climate
change  - and not just a side-effect, according to the report from the US
Geological Survey.

"This is one of the surprises that we haven't talked about much," said Virginia
Burkett, chief climate scientist at the USGS. "It has tremendous implications
for the carbon that is locked up in Alaska soils and vegetation."

A record wildfire year - such as 2015 which was the worst in Alaska for a decade
- had a measurable effect on the release of carbon dioxide and methane, which
are the main drivers of climate change.

"Our scientists found that the balance of carbon storage versus release in
Alaska was strongly linked with wildfires," Burkett said. "In years where there
was high wildfire activity the net carbon balance declined dramatically, and
then it would rebuild in the absence of fire."

Alaska is a far bigger storehouse for carbon than the lower 48 states, according
to the USGS.

The state's boreal forests, peat-rich tundra, and permafrost hold about 53% of
US carbon. Alaska accounts for about 18% of US land mass.

Alaska currently absorbs about 3.7m tonnes of carbon a year, the USGS assessment
found. But that vast storehouse of carbon has been breached by warming
temperatures, thawing permafrost - and wildfire.

The USGS warned last year that Alaska could lose about a quarter of its
permafrost by 2100, accelerating climate change.

In an average year, Alaska wildfires devour twice the area burned by wildfires
in all of the lower 48 - and emit more greenhouse gases than all of those other
wildfires combined, the USGS said.

Such fires across the northern US and Canada - which last month forced the
evacuation of 80,000 from the Alberta tar sands town of Fort McMurray - were
projected to increase over the coming decades as the climate continues to warm.

When it comes to wildfires, there is a triple effect on warming. Carbon stored
in trees as well as the upper layers of soil is released back into the
atmosphere during a fire. The burn also exposes the carbon-rich permafrost
beneath, making it thaw more easily.

The northern US and Canada have already experienced a sharp rise in wildfires
over the last few decades, with more to come.

Researchers predict a fourfold increase in northern wildfires because of warming
and changes in rainfall, extending even to areas above the treeline.

The Arctic smashed through earlier heat records over this last winter - with
temperatures at the North Pole hovering above zero degrees Celsius at the end of
last year.

There were also shortages of snow, with organisers of the legendary Iditarod
resorting to importing truckloads of white stuff for the start of the dog sled
race.

The hotter and drier conditions were a recipe for more wildfires - with
lightning strikes igniting more easily in drier soils and vegetation, and higher
temperatures spreading the flames.

If average July temperatures top 13.4C (56.1F), there could be a big jump in
wildfires in tundra regions such as Alaska's North Slope and the Yukon-Kuskokwim
Delta that were once too damp and cold to burn, the researchers found.

Wildfires in West have gotten bigger, more frequent and longer since the 1980s

LENGTH: 1254 words



 Sacramento: The University of California The state of California has issued the
following news release



 Dramatic images of out-of-control wildfires in western North American forests
have appeared on our television and computer screens with increasing regularity
in recent decades, while costs of fire suppression have soared. In 2015, federal
spending on suppression exceeded $2 billion, just 15 years after first exceeding
$1 billion. Something has been changing our fire seasons.





 There are competing explanations for why wildfires have been increasing,
particularly in our forests. I've been studying the science of climate and
wildfires for more than 15 years and the take-home message from our research is
that, while our management of the landscape can influence wildfire in many
different ways, it is a warming climate that is drying out western U.S. forests
and leading to more, larger wildfires and a longer wildfire season.

 A look at the latest data



 Ten years ago, several colleagues and I set out to see if we could quantify the
changes in wildfire, particularly in mountain forests of the western U.S. We
wanted to see if climate might be causing some of the increase in wildfire.



 In our paper, we concluded that wildfire had indeed increased substantially in
western U.S. forests beginning in the 1980s. We also found that most of this
increase was from fires burning primarily in mid-elevation northern U.S. Rocky
Mountain forests in years with an early snowmelt.



 Our latest research shows that wildfire activity in western U.S. forests has
continued to increase, decade by decade, since the 1980s.



 We looked at federally managed forests in the Sierra Nevada, Southwest, Pacific
Northwest, and northern and southern Rockies. Over the decade through 2012,
large fires (fires greater than 1,000 acres or 400 hectares) were 556 percent
more frequent than in the 1970s and early 1980s. And the area affected increased
even more dramatically: the forest area burned in large fires between 2003 and
2012 was more than 1,200 percent greater than in the period between 1973 and
1982.



 New "hot spots" for forest wildfire have also emerged.



 The area burned in the northern U.S. Rockies has increased by 3,000 percent,
accounting for half of the increase in the western U.S. But fire activity has
recently accelerated in Southwest and Pacific Northwest forests as well. The
area of burned forest in the Southwest increased over 1,200 percent, and in the
Northwest by nearly 5,000 percent.



 The only forest area where we could not robustly detect an increase in large
fires and burned area was in coastal southern California. There, the largest
fires are human-ignited, take place in the fall (driven by Santa Ana winds) and
burn primarily in chaparral or shrubland. The small number of forest fires in
southern California, combined with high variability from year to year, meant we
could not detect trends there, nor attribute them to specific causes.



 At the same time, the number of large fires in the West and the area they
affect have been increasing in drier, lower elevation grass and shrublands,
although to a much lesser extent. For example, the area burned in nonforest
vegetation in lands managed by several federal agencies (the Forest Service,
Park Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs) has been increasing about 65 percent
per decade as compared to the 1970s average, for the past three decades.

 Longer seasons



 The sharp increase in the amount of land being burned in recent decades across
all vegetation types is not just due to more wildfires.



 In fact, the total number of reported wildfire ignitions does not appear to
have gone up. However, the number of large (greater than 1,000 acres or 400
hectares) wildfires has been growing since the 1980s, and the area burned in
these fires has grown even more. Wildfires, in other words, are growing in size.




 The length of the fire season has also grown throughout the last four decades,
with large fires igniting earlier in the spring and later in the autumn than
previously, and burning for longer. In the period between 2003 and 2012, the
average burn time for individual fires was 52 days. In the 1973-1982 period, it
was just six days.

forms of vegetation have increased dramatically.

 The fire season - defined as the time elapsed between the first large fire
ignition and last large fire control - went from 138 days in the 1970s to 222
days in the last decade, for an increase of 84 days.



 The burn duration has increased steadily decade by decade as well, and in each
of the five forest areas we studied. In 1973-82 there were years in each forest
studied without large fires. By the most recent decade, every year saw some
large fires in every forest area.



 These changes in wildfires are strongly linked to drying from warming
temperatures and earlier spring snowmelt.



 For example, the number of large forest fires is strongly correlated with
spring and summer temperatures in each region. The years with the earliest
spring snowmelt, which was one-third of the total number of years we studied,
account for more than 70 percent of the area burned in large forest wildfires,
and 43 percent of the area burned in nonforest fires.

 Timing of spring



 Indeed, most large forest wildfires in the West occurred in warmer years with
earlier spring snowmelt. There was, however, a lot of variation across different
forest areas.



 Forests that historically had large areas with no snow on the ground for two to
four months and high moisture loss from soils and vegetation in spring and
summer have seen the biggest increases in wildfire in early spring snowmelt
years (for example, the northern Rockies and parts of the Sierra Nevada).

 UC Merced wildfire spread

 Since the beginning of comprehensive records in the 1970s, most large fires
have occurred in years with early spring snowmelt. Fires depicted here range
from 1,000 acres (400 hectares) to half a million acres (200,000 hectares).
Fires are scaled by size, but not proportionate to the map.

 In contrast, substantial increase in wildfires in the Southwest were not
strongly correlated with changes in the timing of spring snowmelt. This might in
part be due to the spring timing index we used, which is more representative of
conditions in the Rockies than of conditions in the Southwest. It is also true
that land use and fire suppression have had particularly potent effects on
forests there, with increases in fuels contributing to changes in wildfire.



 Overall, warmer temperatures and earlier snowmelt have contributed to drier
conditions. But cooler, more moist forests, such as those in the northern
Rockies, have seen the greatest drying due to changes in the timing of spring,
and the greatest changes in forest wildfire.



 Our review of historical data demonstrates how closely linked drier years and
earlier springs are to the frequency of wildfires. Given projections for further
drying in the West due to human-induced warming, this study points to a future
with more wildfire activity.

Wildfire prevention measures help reduce fires

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A24

LENGTH: 342  words


Improved tools in the Forest and Prairie Protection Act helped reduce the number
of humancaused wildfires during extreme wildfire conditions this year.

The province's southern forests were tinder-dry for the latter half of the
summer and into the fall. New tools to support fire restrictions, fire bans and
forest area closures helped prevent any catastrophic wildfires.

"The fire hazard in the south this season was extreme. The measures everyone
took to prevent fires from starting were important in protecting our
communities. Patience and co-operation are essential for public safety," said
Oneil Carlier, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry This season, there were 741
human-caused wildfires, which is below the five-year average of 916.

Earlier in the season, hot and dry conditions in B.C. contributed to an
unusually high number of wildfires in that province. Alberta was able to help by
sending more than 560 firefighters to B.C. throughout the fire season. Another
90 were sent to Montana to help with extreme fire conditions in that state.

"I want to thank the wildland firefighters, wildfire experts and wildfire
support staff who lent their expertise to firefighting agencies across Canada
and the U.S. We have a worldclass firefighting program in Alberta and I'm glad
that we were able to share our knowledge with other jurisdictions that have
helped us in the past," said Oneil Carlier, Minister of Agriculture and
Forestry.

Wildfire season facts Firefighters, aircraft and equipment were sent to B.C.,
Yukon, Northwest Territories, Parks Canada, Oregon and Montana this year; From
April 1 to Oct. 31, there were 1,230 wildfires that burned just over 49,000
hectares of Alberta's forests. The five-year average is 1,486 fires burning
approximately 301,000 hectares; and, A forest area closure was put in place in
southern portions of Alberta's forests from Sept. 4 to Sept. 19.

Throughout the winter months, Alberta Wildfire will continue to monitor and
respond to any wildfires. If you see a wildfire in the forest, report it at
310-FIRE (3473).

B.C. still open to tourists, despite ongoing wildfires

B.C.'s official tourism agency wants travellers to know that even with wildfires
burning in some regions, the province is still open for visitors.

Destination B.C.'s vice-president of global marketing, Maya Lange, said Thursday
that while many businesses in the B.C. Interior have been directly affected by
wildfires, there are many which haven't, but are still seeing a drop in
visitors. "B.C. is open to explore," she said Thursday.

"Our thoughts are with all of those impacted and our first priority is ensuring
people are safe and know where to find information," she said. Many vacation
spots have had to close because of the wildfire situation.

"We are extremely proud of the business owners in the affected areas.

They are resourceful, innovative and resilient," and have helped feed and house
emergency personnel fighting wildfires this summer as well as care for evacuees
and stranded travellers, she added.

But businesses in areas not affected by wildfires, like the Thompson-Okanagan or
the Kootenays, have also seen a drop in visitors, especially by people who live
in B.C. and Alberta.

Many of those cancellations, Lange said, have been because of misinformation
about the wildfire or the air quality situation. She suggested travellers check
hellobc.com/wildfire for up-to-date information. Drivers should check DriveBC.ca
for the latest road conditions.

The B.C. Wildfire Service's website is also useful.

Destination B.C. is stepping up efforts to get the word out to locals and to
potential visitors from further afield that "we're still open."

"We are encouraging businesses in non-impacted areas to contact their customers
who have reservations to share updates," she said.

A big push is being put on to connect with potential travellers in B.C. and
Alberta through both traditional means - newspapers and billboards, for instance
- and through social media. On the other hand, there has been a noted surge in
tourism in the coastal parts of the province, especially on Vancouver Island,
Lange said.

And Destination B.C. is adding to its traditional push to promote shoulder
season travel.

There are 138 fires currently burning across the province, the B.C. Wildfire
Service said. There have been 1,031 fires since the beginning of the 2017 fire
season in April, which have burned more than 9,000 square kilometres of land.

That is now the biggest fire season since records were first kept in the early
1950s.

More than $321 million has been spent by the wildfire service this year. Between
firefighters from the wildfire service, personnel from other provinces and
countries and local private contractors, there are more than 4,000 people
currently involved in fighting fires.

August is traditionally the height of the B.C. wildfire season. The wildfire
service's chief fire information officer, Kevin Skrepnek, said there was no
reason to think anything was going to change in the near future.

"Certainly not done this season by any stretch of the imagination," he said.
"Generally warm and dry conditions are going to be the order of the day, going
forward really."

But fire activity, especially on the biggest fires - the Hanceville/Riske Creek
fire west of Williams Lake and the Elephant Hill fire northeast of Cache Creek -
had proved to be lower mid-week versus last weekend.

Even so, the extended forecast suggested very little rain on the way in coming
weeks, he said.

Emergency Management B.C. said the current state of emergency, set to expire
Friday, was being reviewed for possible extension. pjohnston@postmedia.com

Washington: McCAIN & FLAKE APPLAUD FY2018 INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS WILDFIRE
FUNDING PROPOSAL

LENGTH: 399  words



Washington: Office of the Senator John McCain has issued the following news
release:

U.S. Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Jeff Flake (R-AZ) this week applauded a
provision in legislation proposed by the Senate Appropriations Committee that
would boost federal resources for wildfires.


The provision in the Senate Appropriations Committee's Interior, Environment and
Related Agencies Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2018 would take an
important step forward in ending chronic shortfalls in the Forest Service's
wildfire suppression budget. This year, the government spent a record-breaking
$2.9 billion fighting wildfires, while Congress only appropriated $5 billion for
the entire Forest Service budget. The resulting funding imbalance forces the
Forest Service to cannibalize non-wildfire programs such as recreation, trail
maintenance, and wildlife conservation - an increasingly common practice known
as "fire-borrowing." Today, more than 55 percent of the agency budget is devoted
to wildfire suppression compared to 15 percent in the 1990's.
The provision would ensure that the Forest Service receives 100% of the funds it
needs for wildfire suppression based on a 10-year average. The provision would
also allow the Forest Service to tap supplemental emergency wildfire accounts
using a more accurate wildfire budget predicator known as the FLAME forecast
model. The bill's funding structure is similar to legislation introduced in 2015
by Senators McCain, Flake and Barrasso, known as the FLAME Act Amendments. By
appropriating emergency wildfire funding up front - rather than at the end - of
a wildfire season, Congress can help prevent Forest Service fire-borrowing with
increased certainty.
"The Senate Appropriations Committee has taken a positive step forward in
addressing the Forest Service's fire borrowing issue," said Senator McCain. "In
addition to funding wildfire suppression, the long-term solution to reducing
wildfire risk is prevention through industry-driven sustainable forestry. More
than 20 percent of the pine forests in Arizona have been consumed by wildfire,
which is reason enough to make forest ecosystem restoration a top priority at
the Forest Service."
"After working for years to pass the FLAME Act Amendments, it's encouraging to
see the Interior Appropriations Committee put forward a like-minded,
fiscally-responsible solution to fire-borrowing,"

Wildfires Getting More Destructive

LENGTH: 748  words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Berkeley: Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate School has issued the following
news release:



  As 2015 winds to a close, many Californians will remember it as the year
wildfires consumed hundreds of thousands of acres and left countless people
homeless. But the danger from a wildfire doesn't end when the last flame goes
out. It threatens the health of those who've witnessed the embers burning, as
well as the well-being of people who might live hundreds of miles away.





 The potential for smoke to harm air quality and cause health problems was
especially acute this year because a record number of wildfires broke out in the
United States. More than 55,000 wildfires burned over 9.8 million acres in 2015,
according to the National Interagency Fire Center. This is only the fourth year
since 1960 that more than 9 million acres -- an area about twice the size of New
Jersey -- have burned. Each of those four record wildfire years occurred during
the last 10 years.



 Evidence indicates that rising temperatures and severe drought have contributed
to more active and lengthier wildfire seasons, which typically stretch from
spring into fall. The number of wildfires in the West that have burned more than
1,000 acres has increased by a rate of seven fires a year from 1984 to 2011,
according to a 2014 study. In 2015, more than 8,100 wildfires burned nearly
825,000 acres in California, according to the California Department of Forestry
and Fire Protection. About 500,000 acres burn in a typical year.



 Over the summer, smoke from fires in the Northwest blanketed much of the
western third of the United States and traveled as far east as Wyoming. Smoke
from large wildfires in Canada and Alaska traveled thousands of miles and poured
into Montana and the Dakotas.



 When a wildfire occurs, another striking development can accompany it. Visits
to emergency departments and hospitals for respiratory illnesses often spike --
an increase that can last one to two weeks after the fire has been contained,
according to research.



 Air pollution from wildfires may also increase risk of cardiac arrests and
other sudden acute heart problems, concluded a Journal of the American Heart
Association study in July. Researchers found that fine particulate matter air
pollution -- one culprit is burning wood -- often exceeded recommended
air-quality limits during and after wildfires. The particles may act as a
trigger that sets off an acute cardiovascular event. A 2012 study in the Journal
of Forest Economics linked the cardio-respiratory deaths of more than 130 people
in Southern California to the wildfires that ravaged the region.



 Steps can be taken to minimize exposure to wildfire smoke. Those having trouble
breathing should consider evacuating the area, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention advises. Other CDC tips: Monitor local air quality by watching
for news or health warnings about smoke; keep indoor air as clean as possible by
keeping the windows closed and running an air conditioner if possible; and avoid
activities that stir up indoor air pollution, such as making a fire in the
fireplace or operating a vacuum cleaner.



 These recommendations are particularly relevant to those with pre-existing
heart and lung conditions and to older adults, who may be more susceptible to
smoke because of increased risk of heart and lung disease. But the advice also
applies to children, whose smaller bodies can absorb more of a contaminant, and
to pregnant women, whose developing babies could be harmed by the pollutants.



 Public advisories are only as good as the compliance that comes with them. One
way to improve them would be to incorporate better data on the trajectories of
smoke plumes into health advisories, which would result in a more targeted and
helpful alert. This knowledge, coupled with simple actions like having an
adequate supply of food and medications on hand, could cut down on the need to
venture outside, and therefore decrease exposure to toxic pollutants.



 Coping with a wildfire can cause feelings of helplessness. However, pre-event
preparedness can go a long way toward protecting public health. Agencies could
conduct higher profile pre-wildfire season publicity campaigns that highlight
the health risks of wildfire smoke as well as the steps each household can take
to be prepared -- before wildfire season begins all over again.

State Farm awards grant for second annual Wildfire Community Preparedness Day

BYLINE: The Lebanon Democrat, Tenn.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 404 words


Feb. 28--Every year, wildfires burn across the U.S. and an increasing number of
people are living where wildfires are a real risk.

Nearly 45 million homes abut or intermingle with grasslands, forests and
wildlands, and more than 72,000 U.S. communities are threatened by fire.

To help communities prepare and reduce their risk of wildfire damage, State Farm
is providing funding to the National Fire Protection Association Wildland Fire
Operations Division for its second annual Wildfire Community Preparedness Day
event on May 2.

State Farm has a long history of providing proactive wildfire safety education
to its policyholders in high-risk regions, including NFPA's Firewise materials
and concepts.

"State Farm finds it important to inform and encourage homeowners and
communities to adopt effective wildfire mitigation programs that produce
stronger, safer homes where lives are saved and a family's largest investment is
better protected," said Vickie Hodges, State Farm loss mitigation analyst.

The national Preparedness Day event gives people of all ages a chance to
participate in a risk reduction or wildfire preparedness activity that makes
their community a safer place to live. A portion of the State Farm grant funding
will be awarded to 65 neighborhood wildfire risk reduction projects being
implemented during the May 2 event.

Project ideas can be submitted through March 5.

"NFPA is thrilled to be partnering with State Farm for our second annual
Wildfire Community Preparedness Day event," said Lorraine Carli, NFPA vice
president of Outreach and Advocacy. "Their support really does go beyond just
dollars. Both organizations are committed to helping empower and encourage
residents to take action with regard to fire safety. Having an influential
partner like State Farm sends a very powerful message."

Wildfire hazard is a growing threat to communities throughout the United States.
The combination of drought, mild temperatures, high winds and an excess of dried
vegetation in forests and grasslands has made fire seasons progressively worse
over the past 50 years. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, 2013
saw more than four million acres burned.

event, visit wildfireprepday.org.

Washington: Nominations Being Accepted for 2014 Wildfire Emergency Medical
Service Awards

LENGTH: 462  words

DATELINE: Washington


National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians has issued the following
news release:

The National Wildfire Coordinating Group's Incident Emergency Medical
Subcommittee (IEMS) has announced they are accepting nominations for the 2014
Annual Wildfire Emergency Medical Service (EMS) Awards Program.

The NWCG Wildfire EMS Awards Program recognizes and honors individuals and
agencies from a broad spectrum who have demonstrated outstanding work, actions,
or programs in emergency medical service for wildland firefighters.

"There were many fine examples that were submitted during last year's
nominations that illustrated the extraordinary actions and initiatives taken to
provide and assure the health and safety of responders on wildland fire
incidents," said Jan Peterson, Chair of the Incident Emergency Medical
Subcommittee.

"We hear of many responders during the year who go above and beyond the ordinary
call of duty and we seek their nomination for recognition this year," Peterson
said.

Washington: U.S. Representatives Panetta, Carbajal, and Brownley Urge Wildfire
Funding Fix in Omnibus Package

LENGTH: 838  words



Washington: Office of the MP Jimmy Panetta has issued the following news
release:

After the most destructive California wildfire season on record, Central Coast
Reps. Jimmy Panetta (CA-20), Salud Carbajal (CA-24), and Julia Brownley (CA-26)
requested that Congress include a fix to the disruptive wildfire budgeting
practice in their must-pass FY 2018 Omnibus Appropriations Bill. The letter
addresses the long-term problem of consistently underfunding fire suppression, a
practice which currently forces federal agencies to steal from fire prevention
and mitigation funds to fight fires, so-called "fire borrowing."
The United States Forest Service (USFS) spent a record $2.4 billion to put out
fires in FY 2018, requiring $527 million in transfers from other mitigation
accounts within the USFS.


"Two years ago, my community on the central coast of California experienced one
of the most expensive wildfires in U.S. history, the Soberanes fire. To prevent
future fires from devastating our community, Congress must properly fund the
U.S. Forest Services' efficient, effective, and life-saving forest management
activities." said Congressman Panetta. "Stronger investments in fire prevention
efforts, including fuel breaks, ensure forest health and reduce wildfire risk in
communities across California and the nation."
"Congress' failure to address this critical budgeting issue forces USFS to delay
maintenance and puts Central Coast families in greater danger," said Congressman
Carbajal. "Properly funding wildfire mitigation on federal lands means saving
more money in the long-term. Our firefighters face longer and more destructive
fire seasons in California, working around the clock to put out fires near our
homes and businesses. We owe them the resources to implement measures that are
proven to help control future wildfires."
"For many years, my colleagues and I have been trying to address the problem of
'fire-borrowing.'" said Congresswoman Brownley. "We simply must make sure that
the U.S. Forest Service has access to the resources necessary to address
wildfire suppression without having to decimate other programs. I am hopeful
this can be addressed in the upcoming Omnibus, and I am frustrated that Speaker
Ryan has not allowed legislation to fix this problem to come to the floor for a
vote."
Congressman Panetta is a cosponsor of bipartisan legislation to fix the way the
federal government funds the fight against wildfires, H.R. 2862, the Wildfire
Disaster Funding Act, which was introduced by Rep. Mike Simpson, a Republican
from Idaho. The bill categorizes wildfire response as a natural disaster, while
continuing to fund routine wildfire costs through the normal budgeting and
appropriations process. The bill would end the practice of fire borrowing by
funding large wildfires from disaster accounts similar to accounts used to fund
other natural disasters, freeing up funding for critical fire mitigation and
suppression activities like fuel reduction, preparedness and site rehabilitation
for burned areas.
A copy of the letter can be found here and the text is below:
Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi:
As you continue to negotiate a final spending bill for the 2018 fiscal year, we
strongly urge you to include language to fix the way Congress funds wildfire
suppression and fuels management efforts. Since 2000, we have seen prolonged
fire seasons with the frequency and size of fires also rising. This has led to
an increase in the amount of spending drastically needed for fire suppression
activities. In turn, the United States Forest Service (USFS) has continuously
exceeded the amount of funds appropriated to fight wildfires, which has come at
the expense of other programs that reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires and
increase the ability of land to recover from these disasters.
This past year alone was the most expensive year on record. The USFS spent a
record $2.4 billion on wildfire suppression, requiring $527 million in transfers
from other accounts within the USFS. While the transfer of funds is generally
repaid in subsequent appropriations bills, this is a disruptive practice that
impedes land management agencies from doing potentially life-saving mitigation
activities that would reduce the risks of wildfires. It means the USFS can't do
prescribed burns, fuels management, or insect control because Congress has
failed to provide a mechanism to adequately fund the agency and provide
certainty for them to move forward with fire mitigation activities.
Unfortunately, the impacts of these wildfires are widespread. In 2017, there
were 14 federal firefighter fatalities. This past year, the Thomas Fire became
the largest fire in California's history--burning nearly 282,000 acres and
triggering mudslides that claimed the lives of 23 individuals.
Again, we ask that any final spending bill for FY18 include language that would
address this issue. We stand ready to provide any assistance. This is a fix that
is overdue and we need to address.
Sincerely,

Wildfires are making California home insurance unaffordable

SECTION: Y,Y; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 830 words

ABSTRACT

mb "The problem of insurance availability is going to expand" after last year's
record-breaking wildfires, California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said in
an interview Thursday. He said growing rates of non-renewal and rate increases
for people in wildfire zones are "entering a critical stage."

FULL TEXT

More frequent and intense wildfires are making it harder for homeowners to find
and keep insurance in California, a state regulator warned Thursday.

"The problem of insurance availability is going to expand" after last year's
record-breaking wildfires, California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said in
an interview Thursday. He said growing rates of nonrenewal and rate increases
for people in wildfire zones are "entering a critical stage."

Wildfires already were pinching the availability of coverage in large sections
of the state, new data show. The number of homeowners in fire-prone areas who
complained about getting dropped by their plans increased 250 percent from 2010
to 2016, Jones's department reported Thursday. In the 24 counties with the
greatest wildfire risk, the number of policies canceled by companies increased
15 percent from 2015 to 2016 alone; in at least six of

those counties, that number grew by more than 50 percent.

California was struck by a series of wildfires starting last fall that damaged
or destroyed more than 14,700 homes, according to the regulator. Those losses
resulted in "more than $9 billion in insured damages so far." One Southern
California fire started in December, known as the Thomas fire, burned more
acreage than any other blaze in the state's history.

Who pays the cost of the destructive fury

The pressure on California's market is a warning for states elsewhere, according
to climate and industry experts. The number of acres consumed by wildfires each
year has doubled since 2000, according to federal data. The Union of Concerned
Scientists warns that warmer and drier conditions caused by climate change will
mean even more fires. Meanwhile, the number of people who live in the most
fire-prone areas keeps growing.

"We used to have in this country a wildfire season, and now we have wildfire
risk in multiple states all year long," said Julie Rochman, president of the
Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety, an industry-funded research
group that looks at how to make homes more resilient to extreme weather. She
said rising premiums in California reflect the growing exposure to wildfires,
and people in other states could gradually see their rates become harder to
afford as well.

In Thursday's report, the regulator urged lawmakers for changes that would make
it harder for companies to increase rates or cancel coverage. Those proposals
include preventing carriers from dropping homeowners that take specific steps to
reduce their wildfire exposure, requiring insurers to seek state approval for
the models they use to calculate wildfire risk and letting homeowners appeal
those risk calculations.

Providers of residential coverage say they will resist any changes that make it
harder for them to sell policies that reflect the true risk of wildfires. That
would force insurers to charge higher premiums in safer parts of the state,
according to Rex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of
California, which represents the industry.

"Of course, people who choose to live in the forest and local governments that
continue to approve development in the forest would like less fire-prone areas
to subsidize them," Frazier said by email. "But that just 'solves' one problem
by creating another."

Insurers weren't the only ones to warn about reducing the cost of coverage in
wildfire zones. Alice Hill, a senior adviser on climate resilience to President
Barack Obama, said people thinking about buying homes in wildfire areas should
instead use the cost of protection as an indication of whether it's a good idea
to buy there.

"When we see insurers pulling back from markets, it's because the risk is
increasing," Hill, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, said by phone.
"If those risks are getting too high, it's a strong signal that we need to
change our ways."

Jones said he supports changes to local planning and regulations to avoid
putting people in dangerous areas in the first place. But he called higher rates
"a very crude tool" to accomplish that.

"By the time the insurance price signal is being sent, the homes are built, the
businesses are built and people are moving in," Jones said. "If you wait and try
to rely on insurance as a way of getting better decisions made, it's too late."

Rochman, of the institute, said higher prices in California and elsewhere are
more likely to produce still more generous government assistance, subsidizing
people's desire to live where they want, despite the risk.

"We're going to continue to shovel millions and billions of dollars in disaster
recovery out the door," Rochman said. "We're not a country that likes brutal
honesty."

Cause of most US wildfires traced to people, study finds

BYLINE:  By SETH BORENSTEIN AP Science Writer

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A15

LENGTH: 452 words


WASHINGTON - People have triggered 5 out of 6 wildfires in the U.S. over the
last two decades, tripling the length of the wildfire season and making it start
earlier in the East and last longer in the West, a new study finds.

Even as climate change worsens the nation's fire season - making it longer and
easier to burn more acres - researchers say human activities play an even bigger
role.

While fire experts have long blamed people more than lightning, the new work
details the extent of human-caused ignitions and how they interact with global
warming to make matters worse.

Scientists analyzing fire data from 1992 to 2012 found that 84 percent of all
U.S. wildfires - but only 44 percent of the total acres burned - were started by
people, either by accident or on purpose. And human-caused blazes have more than
tripled the length of the wildfire season to 154 days from 46 days, according to
a study in Monday's journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

"People are moving more and more into natural wild areas and essentially
providing ignition for wildfires," said lead author Jennifer Balch, a fire
ecologist at the University of Colorado.

THE SPARK

Of the more than 1 million human-started fires since 1992, about 29 percent
began by trash burning, another 21 percent were arson and 11 percent were from
misuse of equipment, Balch said.

Last year's Soberanes fire in California was sparked by an illegal campfire and
burned for nearly three months. The blaze surpassed $200 million in firefighting
costs, the most expensive in U.S. history.

One out of every five wildfires starts on the Fourth of July from fireworks,
Balch said.

HOTTEST SPOTS

The Southeast is a hot spot for human-triggered wildfires. Kentucky, West
Virginia and Tennessee had fire seasons that lasted more than 200 days, and 99
percent of the wildfires in those states are caused by people.

The region is home to swaths of forests with trees that don't catch fire easily
or naturally, so people are the main culprits, said study co-author Adam Mahood
of the University of Colorado.

CLIMATE CONNECTION

Climate change has lengthened the U.S. fire season by a few weeks, which is
dwarfed by what humans do. But the study shows how both human-sparked flames and
human-made climate change work together to make the country burn more,
especially during more frequent dry, hot weather. "If a campfire grows out of
control during a wet, cool period, then it probably isn't going to grow into a
large wildfire," said University of Utah fire scientist Philip Dennison, who
wasn't part of the study. "Climate change loads the dice toward warmer, drier
conditions that make it more likely that a fire will develop from human-caused
ignitions."

Wildfire prevention measures help reduce fires Improved tools in the Forest and
Prairie Protection Act helped reduce the number of human-caused wildfires during
extreme wildfire conditions this year, says the Alberta government. The
province's southern forests were tinder-dry for the latter half of the summer
and into the fall. New tools to support fire restrictions, fire bans and forest
area closures helped prevent any catastrophic wildfires.

This season, there were 741 humancaused wildfires, which is below the fiveyear
average of 916. Earlier in the season, hot and dry conditions in British
Columbia contributed to an unusually high number of wildfires in that province.
Alberta was able to help by sending more than 560 firefighters to B.C.
throughout the fire season. Another 90 were sent to Montana to help with extreme
fire conditions in that state. Firefighters, aircraft and equipment were also
sent to the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Parks Canada and Oregon this year.

From April 1 to Oct. 31, there were 1,230 wildfires that burned just over 49,000
hectares of Alberta's forests. The fiveyear average is 1,486 fires burning
approximately 301,000 hectares. Throughout the winter months, Alberta Wildfire
will continue to monitor and respond to any wildfires. If you see a wildfire in
the forest, report it at 310-FIRE (3473). Dual credit gives students a head
start Recent changes to the dual credit program have improved access for
students by giving school authorities predictable, sustainable funding to expand
the program across the province, said the Alberta government last week. Dual
credit programming allows students to earn credits for high school and
post-secondary studies at the same time.

This gives students the chance to explore their career options while still in
high school. Since 2013, about 10,000 students have enrolled in at least one
dual credit course each year. Dual credit programming contributes to improved
high school completion rates and supports meaningful connections to the labour
market through workplace experience and hands-on training. In May 2017, Alberta
Education announced $16.4 million in funding for dual credit programming in
Alberta. Following the announcement, Advanced Education, Education, Indigenous
Relations, and Labour worked together to develop the Alberta Dual Credit
Framework and the Dual Credit Implementation Guide.

They provide school authorities with more support and direction to expand the
dual credit program across the province. The Provincial Dual Credit Strategy
(2013-17) was a call to action to school jurisdictions, postsecondary
institutions, and business and industry to collectively expand and increase dual
credit opportunities for students across Alberta. Under the strategy, the
government of Alberta funded 51 dual credit opportunities.

These opportunities were in addition to dual credit partnerships that already
existed at the local level. Evaluation of the strategy confirmed the need for a
provincial implementation of dual credit. The new Alberta Dual Credit Framework
will replace the strategy as the guiding provincial framework for dual credit in
Alberta.

Washington: Wyden, Crapo, Bipartisan Senators to Congress: Permanent Wildfire
Funding Fix Must be a Top Priority

LENGTH: 1259  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Jeff Merkley has issued the following news
release:

In the wake of historic wildfires in Oregon, Idaho, California, Washington and
across the West, U.S. Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., Jim Risch, R-Idaho, Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Michael Bennet,
D-Colo., introduced an updated version of their bipartisan wildfire funding
solution that would protect desperately needed funding for fire prevention and
treat wildfires as the natural disasters they are.


The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act of 2017 would end the destructive cycle of
borrowing from fire prevention accounts to put out fires and stop the erosion of
the Forest Service's budget by reforming the way the federal government funds
wildfires.
"Oregonians and westerners are battling another record-breaking fire year. The
threat of catastrophic wildfires is growing, yet the federal government
continues to conduct 'business as usual' when it comes to fighting fires in
Oregon and the West," Wyden said. "More communities are put in danger and fire
prevention work gets left undone because of a backwards fire budgeting system.
It's past time for Congress to make it a top priority to end fire borrowing,
stop the erosion of the Forest Service becoming the 'Fire Service' and start
treating wildfires like the natural disasters they are."
"If you live in a community in the western United States, you do not need to be
told that wildfires are major natural disasters," Crapo said. "With over eight
million acres burned, ten states choked with smoke, and lives and structures
lost, this year's fire season is a brutal reminder that we must start treating
mega fires as the disasters that they are. Now is the time to both recognize
that fires are major disasters and end the destructive cycle of fire borrowing
that only makes the fire situation in this country worse."
"Wildfires have already burned millions of acres this year across the West, and
the fire season is far from over. It's long past time we treat wildfires like
other natural disasters and allow federal agencies to pay for them like other
natural disasters," Feinstein said. "Our bipartisan bill would end the need for
so-called 'fire borrowing,' where funding for fire prevention efforts is
diverted to fighting wildfires, delaying or canceling critical prevention work.
We must empower federal agencies with the tools they need to protect public
safety and get ahead of what could be yet another catastrophic fire year."
"The West is on fire, and it's burning faster than years prior," Risch said. "We
need every resource available to prevent and combat the devastation caused by
wildfires. This legislation would ensure those of us in the West can count on
much-needed disaster funding."
"Fifty percent more acres have already burned this year than normal and the
trends of the last few years suggest this will likely be our new normal,"
Cantwell said. "The bill we are introducing today will stop the fire-borrowing
that is currently crippling the Forest Service."
"Wildfires continue to decimate Western communities, ruining sources of drinking
water, destroying property, and even claiming lives. Wildfires have all the
qualities of a natural disaster, and it's time that the federal government treat
them as such," Hatch said. "This critical legislation gives much-needed relief
to the Forest Service by putting an end to funding requirements that make it all
but impossible for the agency to bear the increased costs of wildfire
suppression. Ultimately, our bipartisan proposal will leave the Forest Service
better prepared to fight forest fires and better equipped to prevent them from
happening in the first place. It is imperative that we to return to a more
balanced approach to forest management, not just fire management. I am confident
that this bill will help foster safer, healthier forests in Utah and across the
West for years to come."
    "The way we fund wildfire suppression today is counterproductive and crazy,"
Merkley said. "As this fire season has proven all too vividly, robbing from
forest health and fire prevention programs to pay for suppression only creates a
vicious cycle of bigger and bigger fires. It's time to fix this problem once and
for all by funding fighting the biggest wildfires the way we do other natural
disasters."
"It may not be getting headlines in the national news, but wildfires have burned
millions of acres in the West this year and the communities impacted in Colorado
need assistance," Gardner said. "I've been working to advance this legislation
to stop fire borrowing for several years, and I appreciate the strong bipartisan
support to ensure the Forest Service has the funds it needs for clean-up and
prevention efforts while also finally requiring the government to treat
wildfires like it does other natural disasters."
"Catastrophic wildfires continue to plague the West, not only threatening
communities and livelihoods but also draining the Forest Service budget," Bennet
said. "We need to restructure the way we pay for fighting catastrophic fires to
mitigate and prevent future wildfires. This bill would end the practice of fire
borrowing--a necessary step that will enable the Forest Service to make
responsible investments on the front end to restore our forests and safeguard
our watersheds."
Unlike for other natural disasters, where agencies can draw from an emergency
fund to pay for disaster response, the U.S. Forest Service and Interior
Department do not have access to disaster funds and are forced to "fire borrow"
- or steal money from fire prevention and other important programs already
funded in their agencies to pay to put out fires.
Currently, federal agencies calculate wildfire suppression budgets based on the
average costs of wildfire suppression over the past 10 years. But as fire
seasons grow longer and wildfires have become more expensive to fight, Congress
is forced to appropriate more funding to an outdated budgeting system that
almost always underestimates the actual cost of fighting fires.
The updated bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would fund wildfires as
natural disasters and protect the agencies' fire prevention budgets by putting a
freeze on the rising budget costs of the 10-year average. It would end "fire
borrowing" by allowing the agencies to fund any fire suppression spending needed
above the frozen average through disaster funding just like other agencies can
access disaster funding for tornadoes, hurricanes and floods.
Making disaster funding available after the appropriated fire suppression funds
are spent would allow the Forest Service to use its fire prevention funding for
its intended purpose - completing hazardous fuels reduction projects that have
been shown to help break the cycle of increasingly dangerous and costly fires.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that this year has been
the single most expensive fire year on record, with fire suppression activities
totaling more than $2 billion. Addressing the current, problematic system of
wildfire funding is part of a larger need to stabilize and update emergency
spending for all natural disasters.
Earlier this month, Wyden and Crapo, along with 10 other Democratic and
Republican senators urged Senate Leaders Mitch McConnell and Charles E. Schumer
to include a wildfire funding fix in any future disaster aid legislation that
passes through Congress.

safety and get ahead of what could be yet another catastrophic fire year."
 "The West is on fire, and it's burning faster than years prior," Risch said.
"We need every resource available to prevent and combat the devastation caused
by wildfires. This legislation would ensure those of us in the West can count on
much-needed disaster funding."
"Fifty percent more acres have already burned this year than normal and the
trends of the last few years suggest this will likely be our new normal,"
Cantwell said. "The bill we are introducing today will stop the fire-borrowing
that is currently crippling the Forest Service."
"Wildfires continue to decimate Western communities, ruining sources of drinking
water, destroying property, and even claiming lives. Wildfires have all the
qualities of a natural disaster, and it's time that the federal government treat
them as such," Hatch said. "This critical legislation gives much-needed relief
to the Forest Service by putting an end to funding requirements that make it all
but impossible for the agency to bear the increased costs of wildfire
suppression. Ultimately, our bipartisan proposal will leave the Forest Service
better prepared to fight forest fires and better equipped to prevent them from
happening in the first place. It is imperative that we to return to a more
balanced approach to forest management, not just fire management. I am confident
that this bill will help foster safer, healthier forests in Utah and across the
West for years to come."
"The way we fund wildfire suppression today is counterproductive and crazy,"
Merkley said. "As this fire season has proven all too vividly, robbing from
forest health and fire prevention programs to pay for suppression only creates a
vicious cycle of bigger and bigger fires. It's time to fix this problem once and
for all by funding fighting the biggest wildfires the way we do other natural
disasters."
"It may not be getting headlines in the national news, but wildfires have burned
millions of acres in the West this year and the communities impacted in Colorado
need assistance," Gardner said. "I've been working to advance this legislation
to stop fire borrowing for several years, and I appreciate the strong bipartisan
support to ensure the Forest Service has the funds it needs for clean-up and
prevention efforts while also finally requiring the government to treat
wildfires like it does other natural disasters."
"Catastrophic wildfires continue to plague the West, not only threatening
communities and livelihoods but also draining the Forest Service budget," Bennet
said. "We need to restructure the way we pay for fighting catastrophic fires to
mitigate and prevent future wildfires. This bill would end the practice of fire
borrowing--a necessary step that will enable the Forest Service to make
responsible investments on the front end to restore our forests and safeguard
our watersheds."
Unlike for other natural disasters, where agencies can draw from an emergency
fund to pay for disaster response, the U.S. Forest Service and Interior
Department do not have access to disaster funds and are forced to "fire borrow"
- or steal money from fire prevention and other important programs already
funded in their agencies to pay to put out fires.
Currently, federal agencies calculate wildfire suppression budgets based on the
average costs of wildfire suppression over the past 10 years. But as fire
seasons grow longer and wildfires have become more expensive to fight, Congress
is forced to appropriate more funding to an outdated budgeting system that
almost always underestimates the actual cost of fighting fires.
The updated bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would fund wildfires as
natural disasters and protect the agencies' fire prevention budgets by putting a
freeze on the rising budget costs of the 10-year average. It would end "fire
borrowing" by allowing the agencies to fund any fire suppression spending needed
above the frozen average through disaster funding just like other agencies can
access disaster funding for tornadoes, hurricanes and floods.
Making disaster funding available after the appropriated fire suppression funds
are spent would allow the Forest Service to use its fire prevention funding for
its intended purpose - completing hazardous fuels reduction projects that have
been shown to help break the cycle of increasingly dangerous and costly fires.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that this year has been
the single most expensive fire year on record, with fire suppression activities
totaling more than $2 billion. Addressing the current, problematic system of
wildfire funding is part of a larger need to stabilize and update emergency
spending for all natural disasters.
Earlier this month, Wyden and Crapo, along with 10 other Democratic and
Republican senators urged Senate Leaders Mitch McConnell and Charles E. Schumer
to include a wildfire funding fix in any future disaster aid legislation that
passes through Congress.

Emergency Management British Columbia

Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development

Summer is gradually coming to a close, but the wildfire risk in many parts of
the province remains a very serious concern. British Columbians are urged to
exercise caution and remain vigilant to help prevent human-caused wildfires.

During this period of heightened wildfire risk, the British Columbia government
is strongly recommending that people stay completely out of the backcountry
within the Cariboo Fire Centre, Kamloops Fire Centre and Southeast Fire Centre.

The public is advised to not visit recreation sites in the Cariboo, Kamloops or
Southeast fire centres over the Labour Day long weekend. Visitors currently
camping and using recreation sites in the Cariboo, Kamloops and Southeast fire
centres are encouraged to leave.

Recreation Sites and Trails BC

Closures of numerous recreation site and trails are in effect in the Cariboo,
Southeast and Kamloops fire centres. For a complete list of current closures,
please visit: http://www.sitesandtrailsbc.ca/closures.aspx

Recreationalists are encouraged to avoid travelling in the backcountry in areas
where wildfires are active or where the fire danger rating is high to extreme.
Given the current fire danger ratings and number of active wildfires, further
restrictions may be considered if people do not stay out of the backcountry.

More information on Recreation Sites and Trails BC is available .

Current Wildfire Activity

From April 1 to Aug. 30, 2017, the BC Wildfire Service responded to 1,156
wildfires throughout the province, with 425 of those fires caused by people.
Over 1,073,010 hectares have been burned in the province to date - the highest
number of hectares burned since government started keeping such records in 1912.

The 2017 fire season is far from over and much of British Columbia is still
experiencing extreme fire danger ratings. Significant wildfire activity is
expected to continue into the fall.

Human-caused fires are completely preventable and unnecessarily tie up
firefighting resources that could be used to deal with naturally occurring
wildfire starts and the wildfires that are already burning.

Campfires are banned in many regions of the province. Information about current
open burning prohibitions (including campfire bans) is available on the BC
Wildfire Service website .

Off-road vehicle prohibition

The operation of any off-road vehicle for recreational purposes on Crown land is
currently prohibited throughout the Cariboo Fire Centre, Kamloops Fire Centre
and Southeast Fire Centre. The operation of any off-road vehicles in these
regions during the current wildfire situation creates a potential wildfire risk.

A map of the affected areas is available online .

In addition, all on-highway vehicles must remain on defined road surfaces. While
trucks and other on-highway vehicles are permitted on designated roads, they are
not allowed off-road. The prohibition of off-road vehicles and on-highway
vehicles does not apply to private lands or national parks. It also does not
apply to emergency responders or to agriculture or commercial/ industrial users
who operate vehicles for farming, emergency response or business purposes.

With bow hunting season scheduled to begin Friday, Sept. 1 and rifle hunting
season on Sept. 10, 2017, registered guides and outfitters are advised that the
off-road vehicle prohibition does not apply to them while they're using ORVs for
business purposes. This includes guiding clients who are using ORVs to hunt or
gain access to the backcountry. This supersedes any previous communication
regarding ORV use by guide outfitters in the southeast.

Anyone found in contravention of this prohibition may be issued a violation
ticket in the amount of $767. If the contravention causes or contributes to a
wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and
associated costs.

Fines

Anyone found in contravention of an open-burning prohibition may be issued a
violation ticket for $1,150, may be required to pay an administrative penalty of
up to $10,000 or, if convicted in court, may be fined up to $100,000 and/or
sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a
wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and
associated costs.

Know Before You Go - DriveBC

Provincial transportation routes will be busy and drivers can expect possible
delays due to the higher volume of long-weekend travellers. Please plan your
trip well in advance, pack food and bottled water for yourselves as well as your
pets, allow for plenty of extra time, and drive safely. For up-to-date route
information, please visit: www.drivebc.ca or on Twitter .

Know Before You Go - BC Parks

Most provincial parks remain open for recreational and camping activities.
However, due to the serious nature of the current wildfire situation, numerous
BC Parks remain closed to protect public safety.

Prior to closing parks, BC Parks works in co-ordination with the BC Wildfire
Service and multiple factors are taken into consideration, such as weather
conditions and forecasts, access routes, the presence of active fires, and
fire-danger ratings. Wildfires are dynamic and circumstances can change quickly.
BC Parks and the BC Wildfire Service assess situations on a daily basis.

The public is encouraged to continue to monitor BC Parks' website for the most
up-to-date information on provincial park closure.

British Columbians and visitors are urged to follow the instructions of BC Parks
staff, BC Wildfire Service officials, the RCMP, conservation officers and other
authorized personnel in the area. See an alphabetical list of B.C. parks and
their status .

Health and Wellness

Air quality in B.C. continues to fluctuate due to wildfire activity. Poor air
quality can be harmful to health, especially for children, older adults, and
those with heart and lung conditions. Forest-fire smoke is a complex and dynamic
mixture of gases and small particles that can irritate the respiratory system
and cause systemic inflammation.

Here are some tips to help minimize health effects:

* If you have a chronic condition, have rescue medication on hand at all times
and a plan to follow if your rescue medication cannot bring your condition under
control.

* Look for indoor environments that might be less smoky, such as shopping malls,
community centres and libraries.

* Avoid physical exertion because the amount of smoke you breathe increases as
your breathing rate increases.

* Keep hydrated as it helps your body deal with inflammation.

If you are feeling unwell, you can call 811, a free-of-charge provincial health
information and advice phone line available in British Columbia. If you or a
loved one is experiencing a medical emergency, please call 911.

For more information on health and safety, see WorkSafeBC's Wildfire Smoke FAQ

The Red Cross: New Wildfire App Brings Safety Information to Mobile Devices

LENGTH: 695  words


New Delhi, Oct. 30 -- On the heels of a major drought and busy wildfire season,
the American Red Cross today released its official Wildfire App. The app puts
lifesaving information right in the hands of people who live in or who visit
wildfire prone areas.



This free app-available in English or Spanish-is the fourth in a series created
by the American Red Cross, the nation's leader in emergency preparedness, for
use on both iPhone and Android platforms. The Wildfire App comes after the
highly successful First Aid, Hurricane and Earthquake Apps, which have more than
1.2 million users.

"It is vital that people know what to do to help protect themselves, their loved
ones and their property from wildfires," said Scott C. Somers, Ph.D., member of
the American Red Cross Scientific Advisory Council and fire management expert
based in Arizona. "App users have instant access to our 'Blaze Tracker' features
so they know what to do before, during and after wildfires and make the critical
decisions that can save lives."

This year, the Red Cross has launched 11 large wildfire relief operations
spanning 10 states. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, as of
October, wildfires have burned 8.8 million acres in the United States this year.


The Wildfire App includes the "Blaze Tracker" trio of features-which can be
customized for alerts specific to locations where they live, travel or have
loved ones:

* "Blaze Warnings" which let users see areas where NOAA has issued warnings that
conditions are favorable for potential wildfires;

* "Blaze Alerts" inform users when a wildfire has begun within 100 miles of any
locations monitored; and

* "Blaze Path" from Inciweb.org which provides users with a current view of an
existing wildfire's perimeter, how it has spread and the fire's current location
when available;

Other features include:

* Comprehensive reporting of all wildfire activity for every geographic area in
the United States;

* Options to view the app in English or Spanish based on user language settings;


* One touch "I'm safe" messaging that allows users to broadcast reassurance to
family and friends via social media outlets that they are out of harm's way;

* Locations of open Red Cross shelters;

* Simple steps and checklists people can use to create a family emergency plan;

* Preloaded content that gives users instant access to critical action steps,
even without mobile connectivity;

* Toolkit with flashlight, strobe light and audible alarm; and

* Badges users can earn through interactive quizzes and share on social
networks.

"One of the reasons why the Red Cross has emerged as a leader in mobile
preparedness is our ability to provide users with location customization," said
Jack McMaster, president of Preparedness and Health and Safety Services for the
Red Cross. "Wildfire App users can receive notification of wildfire risk and
activity within 100 miles of locations that matter most to them - whether it's
the community where they live or the places where friends and loved ones live."

National Red Cross experts in health, safety and preparedness have thoroughly
reviewed and field tested the information and advice provided in Red Cross apps.
A recent Red Cross survey found that apps have tied social media as the fourth
most popular way for people to get information during emergencies, making the
Red Cross app development effort even more important.

The Wildfire App can be found in the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store
for Android by searching for American Red Cross. Apps can help prepare people
for disasters, but they are not a substitute for training. Red Cross First Aid
and CPR/AED training empowers people to know how to respond to emergencies in
case advanced medical help is delayed. People can go to redcross.org/takeaclass
for course information and to register.

The Red Cross responds to nearly 70,000 disasters each year and we help people
get ready to respond to emergencies by providing these apps for free. The Red
Cross needs the help of the public to continue this lifesaving effort. People
can make a donation to the Red Cross by going to redcross.org, texting REDCROSS
to 90999 or by calling 1-800-REDCROSS.

Washington: Bipartisan Senators to Congress: Permanent Wildfire Funding Fix Must
be a Top Priority

LENGTH: 1218  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Jim Risch has issued the following news
release:

In the wake of historic wildfires in Oregon, Idaho, California, Washington and
across the West, U.S. Sens. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, Ron Wyden,
D-Ore., Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Michael Bennet,
D-Colo., introduced an updated version of their bipartisan wildfire funding
solution that would protect desperately needed funding for fire prevention and
treat wildfires as the natural disasters they are.


The  Wildfire Disaster Funding Act of 2017 would end the destructive cycle of
borrowing from fire prevention accounts to put out fires and stop the erosion of
the Forest Service's budget by reforming the way the federal government funds
wildfires.
"The West is on fire, and it's burning faster than years prior," Risch said.
"We need every resource available to prevent and combat the devastation caused
by wildfires. This legislation would ensure those of us in the West can count on
much-needed disaster funding."
  "Oregonians and westerners are battling another record-breaking fire year. The
threat of catastrophic wildfires is growing, yet the federal government
continues to conduct 'business as usual' when it comes to fighting fires in
Oregon and the West," Wyden said. "More communities are put in danger and fire
prevention work gets left undone because of a backwards fire budgeting system.
It's past time for Congress to make it a top priority to end fire borrowing,
stop the erosion of the Forest Service becoming the 'Fire Service' and start
treating wildfires like the natural disasters they are."
"If you live in a community in the western United States, you do not need to be
told that wildfires are major natural disasters," Crapo said.  "With over eight
million acres burned, ten states choked with smoke, and lives and structures
lost, this year's fire season is a brutal reminder that we must start treating
mega fires as the disasters that they are. Now is the time to both recognize
that fires are major disasters and end the destructive cycle of fire borrowing
that only makes the fire situation in this country worse."
"Wildfires have already burned millions of acres this year across the West, and
the fire season is far from over. It's long past time we treat wildfires like
other natural disasters and allow federal agencies to pay for them like other
natural disasters," Feinstein said. "Our bipartisan bill would end the need for
so-called 'fire borrowing,' where funding for fire prevention efforts is
diverted to fighting wildfires, delaying or canceling critical prevention work.
We must empower federal agencies with the tools they need to protect public
safety and get ahead of what could be yet another catastrophic fire year."

Washington: Bipartisan Group of Senators To Congress: Permanent Wildfire Funding
Fix Must be a Top Priority

LENGTH: 1217  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Dianne Feinstein has issued the following news
release:
In the wake of historic wildfires in California, Oregon, Idaho, Washington and
across the West, Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Mike
Crapo (R-Idaho), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Orrin Hatch
(R-Utah), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Michael Bennet
(D-Colo.) introduced an updated version of their bipartisan wildfire funding
solution that would protect desperately needed funding for fire prevention and
treat wildfires as the natural disasters they are.


The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act of 2017 would end the destructive cycle of
borrowing from fire prevention accounts to put out fires and stop the erosion of
the Forest Service's budget by reforming the way the federal government funds
wildfires.
"Wildfires have already burned millions of acres this year across the West, and
the fire season is far from over. It's long past time we treat wildfires like
other natural disasters and allow federal agencies to pay for them like other
natural disasters," Feinstein said. "Our bipartisan bill would end the need for
so-called 'fire borrowing,' where funding for fire prevention efforts is
diverted to fighting wildfires, delaying or canceling critical prevention work.
We must empower federal agencies with the tools they need to protect public
safety and get ahead of what could be yet another catastrophic fire year."
"Oregonians and westerners are battling another record-breaking fire year. The
threat of catastrophic wildfires is growing, yet the federal government
continues to conduct 'business as usual' when it comes to fighting fires in
Oregon and the West," Wyden said. "More communities are put in danger and fire
prevention work gets left undone because of a backwards fire budgeting system.
It's past time for Congress to make it a top priority to end fire borrowing,
stop the erosion of the Forest Service becoming the 'Fire Service' and start
treating wildfires like the natural disasters they are."
"If you live in a community in the western United States, you do not need to be
told that wildfires are major natural disasters," Crapo said. "With over eight
million acres burned, ten states choked with smoke, and lives and structures
lost, this year's fire season is a brutal reminder that we must start treating
mega fires as the disasters that they are. Now is the time to both recognize
that fires are major disasters and end the destructive cycle of fire borrowing
that only makes the fire situation in this country worse."
"The West is on fire, and it's burning faster than years prior," Risch said. "We
need every resource available to prevent and combat the devastation caused by
wildfires. This legislation would ensure those of us in the West can count on
much-needed disaster funding."
"Fifty percent more acres have already burned this year than normal and the
trends of the last few years suggest this will likely be our new normal,"
Cantwell said. "The bill we are introducing today will stop the fire-borrowing
that is currently crippling the Forest Service."
"Wildfires continue to decimate Western communities, ruining sources of drinking
water, destroying property, and even claiming lives. Wildfires have all the
qualities of a natural disaster, and it's time that the federal government treat
them as such," Hatch said. "This critical legislation gives much-needed relief
to the Forest Service by putting an end to funding requirements that make it all
but impossible for the agency to bear the increased costs of wildfire
suppression. Ultimately, our bipartisan proposal will leave the Forest Service
better prepared to fight forest fires and better equipped to prevent them from
happening in the first place. It is imperative that we to return to a more
balanced approach to forest management, not just fire management. I am confident
that this bill will help foster safer, healthier forests in Utah and across the
West for years to come."
"The way we fund wildfire suppression today is counterproductive and crazy,"
Merkley said. "As this fire season has proven all too vividly, robbing from
forest health and fire prevention programs to pay for suppression only creates a
vicious cycle of bigger and bigger fires. It's time to fix this problem once and
for all by funding fighting the biggest wildfires the way we do other natural
disasters."
"It may not be getting headlines in the national news, but wildfires have burned
millions of acres in the West this year and the communities impacted in Colorado
need assistance," Gardner said. "I've been working to advance this legislation
to stop fire borrowing for several years, and I appreciate the strong bipartisan
support to ensure the Forest Service has the funds it needs for clean-up and
prevention efforts while also finally requiring the government to treat
wildfires like it does other natural disasters."
"Catastrophic wildfires continue to plague the West, not only threatening
communities and livelihoods but also draining the Forest Service budget," Bennet
said. "We need to restructure the way we pay for fighting catastrophic fires to
mitigate and prevent future wildfires. This bill would end the practice of fire
borrowing--a necessary step that will enable the Forest Service to make
responsible investments on the front end to restore our forests and safeguard
our watersheds."
Unlike for other natural disasters, where agencies can draw from an emergency
fund to pay for disaster response, the U.S. Forest Service and Interior
Department do not have access to disaster funds and are forced to "fire borrow"
- or steal money from fire prevention and other important programs already
funded in their agencies to pay to put out fires.
Currently, federal agencies calculate wildfire suppression budgets based on the
average costs of wildfire suppression over the past 10 years. But as fire
seasons grow longer and wildfires have become more expensive to fight, Congress
is forced to appropriate more funding to an outdated budgeting system that
almost always underestimates the actual cost of fighting fires.
The updated bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would fund wildfires as
natural disasters and protect the agencies' fire prevention budgets by putting a
freeze on the rising budget costs of the 10-year average. It would end "fire
borrowing" by allowing the agencies to fund any fire suppression spending needed
above the frozen average through disaster funding just like other agencies can
access disaster funding for tornadoes, hurricanes and floods.
Making disaster funding available after the appropriated fire suppression funds
are spent would allow the Forest Service to use its fire prevention funding for
its intended purpose - completing hazardous fuels reduction projects that have
been shown to help break the cycle of increasingly dangerous and costly fires.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that this year has been
the single most expensive fire year on record, with fire suppression activities
totaling more than $2 billion. Addressing the current, problematic system of
wildfire funding is part of a larger need to stabilize and update emergency
spending for all natural disasters.

Washington: Putting Out the Fire: 3 Reasons Why President Obama's Proposed
Reforms to the Wildfire Budget Are Critical for Our Public Lands

LENGTH: 746  words

DATELINE: Washington


The Center for American Progress has issued the following news release:

With just two weeks to go until Memorial Day, wildfire season is already in full
swing. This year, California already has seen more than 1,100 fires--double the
average of the previous five years--and experts are forecasting above-normal
wildfire potential across much of the West this summer.

The U.S. Global Change Research Program recently released the National Climate
Assessment, a survey of the best available science about the effects of climate
change in the United States. It predicts that over the next 50 years, the area
burned by wildfires will double in the southern Rockies and increase by as much
as 74 percent in California as wildfire seasons become longer and more damaging.
In the West, climate change is resulting in drier and hotter weather, more
intense and frequent droughts, and low snowpack that, taken together, are
increasing the risks of wildfire.

Battling blazes and protecting communities is costly, and more wildfires mean
higher costs. Yet the agencies tasked with fighting fires on public lands--the
U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Forest Service--have long grappled
with major budget shortfalls.

From 1991 to 1999, the agencies spent an average of $1.4 billion per year on
wildfires, according to a Headwaters Economics report. This figure has more than
doubled between 2002 and 2012, with the agencies spending an average of $3.5
billion to fight wildfires. Just last week, a congressionally mandated report
concluded that this year alone, the Forest Service and the Interior Department
will spend upwards of $1.8 billion combating wildfires, though they have only
$1.4 billion budgeted, resulting in an almost $470 million shortfall.

To address these ballooning costs and to ensure that wildfire suppression costs
do not overwhelm agency budgets, President Barack Obama has proposed a plan to
overhaul how the United States pays the costs of responding to the most
catastrophic wildfires.

The plan, outlined in the president's fiscal year 2015 budget proposal and based
on legislation introduced by Sens. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Mike Crapo (R-ID) and
Reps. Mike Simpson (R-ID) and Kurt Schrader (D-OR), would treat the worst 1
percent of wildfires as a natural disaster similar to hurricanes or tornados. In
turn, federal agencies would be able to draw funds from a special disaster
account dedicated to combating extreme fires. This common-sense proposal will
have far-reaching benefits for American communities, parks, and public lands. We
highlight three of these benefits below.
1. The president's plan frees up money for much-needed fire prevention and
mitigation on public lands

In recent years, the worst 1 percent of wildfires have consumed 30 percent of
total fire suppression budgets, and agencies have regularly had to divert
resources from other priorities, including fire prevention, to pay these costs.
Dan Glickman, former secretary of agriculture in the Clinton administration,
raised significant concerns about this lack of funding to fight and get ahead of
wildfires and the constant need for agencies to borrow money from other pockets
to cover costs: "It's like we're robbing Peter to pay Paul almost always to
fight fires, and it's going to get worse, and we'd better figure out a way to
have the resources to do that or else a lot of lives will be lost in the
process."

The president's budget proposal would treat extreme wildfires--or
"megafires"--as natural disasters, which are currently funded outside
discretionary spending limits. This would free up critical funds needed to
proactively fight fires. Indeed, estimates for removing megafires from the
regular budget indicate that up to $412 million in funding could be made
available.

Wildfires have become more violent and prevalent over the years due to climate
change, among other factors; borrowing funds from other agency programs has
become the norm. The Interior Department and the Forest Service have greatly
exceeded their wildfire budgets in 7 out of the past 12 years, using funds
budgeted for hazardous fuels reduction, wildfire prevention, and emergency
stabilization to make up the difference. The agencies had to use $636 million
from other programs last year to pay for wildfire suppression, and overall
borrowing since 2002 exceeded $3 billion for the Forest Service and $422 million
for the Interior Department.

Washington: Tester Demands the Forest Service Listen to Montana Scientists

LENGTH: 331  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Jon Tester has issued the following news
release:
Senator Jon Tester is defending Montana fire experts and calling on the U.S.
Forest Service to allow them to present their research at a national wildfire
conference.


Tester is demanding that Missoula Fire Lab scientists be allowed to travel to
the International Fire Ecology and Management Congress Conference later this
month. The Forest Service is reportedly denying requests for Montana fire
scientists to attend the conference where critical research will be shared after
a catastrophic wildfire season.
"The 2017 wildfire season is the most expensive one in history," Tester wrote in
a letter to Forest Service Chief Tony Tooke. "In Montana alone, we've seen more
than 1.2 million acres burned by wildfires, with enormous impacts to our state's
outdoor economy, destroyed homes and property, and the tragic loss of two
firefighters. Now is the time for us to invest in better understanding wildfire
and forest management, not silencing Montana voices who have seen wildfire
firsthand."
Scientists from Missoula's Fire Science Lab conduct world-class, cutting-edge
research on wildfire and its impact on communities and the environment.
Fighting wildfires in Montana has cost taxpayers more than $389 million this
year, and almost 9 million acres burned this wildfire season across the country.

The intense wildfire season once again forced the Forest Service to borrow
hundreds of millions of dollars from forest management accounts to pay for fire
suppression. The cost of fighting wildfires has dramatically increased from 16
percent of the Forest Service's budget in 1995 to over 50 percent today.
During a Senate Floor speech last week, Tester pushed the Senate to move forward
with his bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act to provide a long-term funding
fix for the Forest Service by ending fire borrowing and funding catastrophic
wildfires the same way as other natural disasters.

Wildfire threat tackled by new squad

BYLINE: David Kerr

SECTION: NEWS; 999; Fires; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 468 words


New plans to tackle wildfires have been unveiled amid fears the spring could
bring another wave of the devastating outbreaks which have plagued the north and
north-east.

A hand-picked squad of officers with specialist knowledge and training will be
created to try to ease the massive strain put on the fire service during long
spells of dry weather over the past few years.

Ironically, the measures are being unveiled as brigade chiefs continue to face a
backlash from the public and politicians over their decision to axe vital
control rooms in Inverness and Aberdeen.

Crews tackled about 240 wildfires in four weeks in March and April last year.

At one point, firefighters across the Highlands and islands were trying to bring
50 separate blazes under control and helicopters were used in isolated areas to
water bomb the flames. Two senior north-based firefighters will be in charge of
efforts to reduce the number of incidents, which caused hundreds of thousands of
pounds of damage last year. Garry Burnett will take on a new full-time position
dealing with the management and prevention of wildfires.

The north of Scotland's top firefighter, Assistant Chief Officer Robert Scott,
will be at the helm of the Scottish Wildfire Forum (SWFF), whose members include
landowners.

Mr Scott hopes the tough new approach to the problem will raise awareness,
encourage public responsibility and reduce demand on the service during the
wildfire season.

The announcement of the strategy follows the launch of the UK's first Wildfire
Operational Guidance Manual by the group last year.

Mr Scott said: "In addition to the launch of the guidance manual we have
committed significant resources to training a number of senior officers to an
advanced level to ensure we have experts available across the country to attend
and control wildfire incidents. We have trained over 100 supervisory managers,
based in fire stations most likely to attend these types of incidents, to ensure
they do so safely and to maximum effect."

The new wildfire measures have been announced as the Scottish Fire and Rescue
Service forges ahead with plans to close control rooms in Inverness and Aberdeen
and route 999 calls through Dundee instead.

Newly-appointed Mr Burnett will be based in Aberdeen and will have a specific
brief of dealing with wildfires. He said: "For me, personally, I am delighted to
be returning to the wildfire environment nearly 10 years after supporting the
delivery of the first Scottish Wildfire Forum in 2005."

Community Safety Minister Roseanna Cunningham MSP said: "Wildfires can have a
devastating impact on communities, agriculture and environment across the
country.

"The guidance has provided fire and rescue services with information on how to
tackle the behaviour, prevention and management of wildfire."

Washington: Bennet, Crapo, Tester, Risch Introduce Bill to Provide Resources for
Fire Mitigation Work

LENGTH: 1170  words



 Washington: Office of the Senator Michael Bennet, U.S Government has issued the
following news release:



 Today, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet, Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID), Senator
Jon Tester (D-MT), and Senator Jim Risch (R-ID) introduced The Wildfire
Mitigation Assistance Act to provide more funding to mitigate the effects of
wildfires and prevent future fires. The bill treats wildfires in the same manner
as other natural disasters by allowing Hazard Mitigation Assistance funding to
be provided to states affected by catastrophic wildfires that have received Fire
Management Assistance Grants (FMAG).





 Currently, hazard mitigation funding to lessen the effects of a future disaster
can only be provided to states after the President declares a major disaster.
However, unlike in the case of hurricanes, floods, or tornados, most wildfires
do not receive a major disaster declaration. Instead, wildfires are paid for
using FMAG funding and do not receive funding for mitigation efforts to prevent
the next wildfire. Wildfire mitigation efforts are proven to reduce the costs
and long-term effects of wildfires on communities, properties, and watersheds.



 Colorado's request for an FMAG declaration to combat the Cold Springs Fire
burning in Boulder County was approved on July 10th. The fire has destroyed
eight homes and is threatening many more in and around Nederland. The fire
started on July 9, 2016, and is currently burning more than 550 acres. The
Wildfire Mitigation Assistance Act would allow the state to apply for funding to
mitigate the effects of the Cold Springs Fire, reducing the risk of flooding,
erosion, and future fires in the area.



 "Throughout the west, we have seen an increase in wildfires like the ones
burning across Colorado right now that are destroying property and habitats and
resulting in the tragic loss of life," Bennet said. "We can dramatically reduce
the severity and damage caused by fires through mitigation work. For every
dollar we spend on mitigation efforts like reducing fuel loads, there is an
average savings of four dollars in recovery spending. Our bill will treat fires
like other natural disasters by providing post-fire mitigation funding to
affected communities."



 "The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)spends a good deal of money
every year helping communities at risk of natural disasters prepare for
disasters such as flood preparation for hurricanes or modification to houses in
Tornado Alley," said Crapo. "However, FEMA spends very little money assisting
communities at risk of being impacted by wildfires. Our legislation would
address that disparity by allowing fire-prone communities apply for Hazard
Mitigation grants to undertake 'fire-wise' projects for homes in the wildland
urban interface or reduce hazardous fuels."



 "We have seen the catastrophic impacts of wildfires across Montana and the west
and we must do more to prevent them and reduce their devastation," Tester said.
"We know that a wildfire doesn't end when the flames stop burning. This bill
will provide additional resources to restore land after a wildfire sweeps
through, preventing future disasters."



 "Although many of my eastern colleagues do not fully appreciate the situation,
wildfires continue to wreak havoc in the western part of our country and this
continuing threat is very real," said Risch. "The Wildfire Mitigation Assistance
Act will be a longer-lasting, positive solution to the ever-increasing need for
funds to prevent and battle fires."



 "Wildfires threaten the health and safety of communities, contaminate waters,
damage wildlife habitats and impact county economies by reducing opportunities
for jobs and tourism on the land," said National Association of Counties (NACo)
President and El Paso County Commissioner Sallie Clark. "The Wildfire Mitigation
Assistance Act leverages federal, state and local resources to address the
factors that most directly contribute to catastrophic wildfires before they
happen. Counties applaud Senators Bennet, Crapo, and Tester for their leadership
and urge Congress to enact meaningful legislation to reduce wildfire risks and
associated costs for response and recovery, improve the health of federal
forests and ensure the long-term health and viability of our lands and
communities."



 "I applaud Senators Bennet, Tester and Crapo for introducing this important
legislation," said Chief Rhoda Mae Kerr, International Association of Fire
Chiefs President and Chair of the Board. "Even after the wildland fires are
extinguished, communities are still at risk for future floods and landslides.
This legislation will help states and communities mitigate that risk."



 "While we are frequently judged based on response and criticized based on
recovery, mitigation and preparedness are critical phases of emergency
management and they most often occur outside the spotlight," said President of
the U.S. Council of the International Association of Emergency Managers
President Robie Robinson. "As mitigation is the linchpin of emergency
management, expanding hazard mitigation grant funding following a Fire
Management Assistance Grant declaration will enable jurisdictions to implement
programs that will effectively reduce risks and return benefits many fold."



 The Fiscal Year 2015 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill
included a one-year authority to provide hazard mitigation grants following FMAG
declarations. That authority is being used to develop and implement fire
mitigation projects in nine states and one tribe that received FMAG declarations
for wildfires between March and September 2015. This bill would make that
authority permanent. This measure was originally introduced as part of the
PREPARE Act Bennet and Crapo introduced last August.



 This bill has the support of local elected officials, state and local emergency
managers, major fire service organizations, and floodplain managers. The bill is
also supported by the National Association of Counties, the International
Association of Emergency Managers, US Council, the International Association of
Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Fire Fighters, the National
Emergency Management Association, the National Fire Protection Association, the
Association of State Floodplain Managers, and the National Volunteer Fire
Council.



 The Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) Program provides federal funding to
states, local governments, and tribes for firefighting and emergency protective
measures for fires on public or private forests that are considered major
disasters. Funding is currently only available for activities while the fire is
burning.



 The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) provides federal funding to help
communities implement measures in the wake of a Presidential major disaster
declaration to reduce long-term risk to people and property from future natural
disasters.

Idaho: Crapo, Wyden, Bipartisan Senators to Congress: Permanent Wildfire Funding
Fix Must be a Top Priority

LENGTH: 1239  words



Boise: The United States of Senator Crapo,Idaho has issued the following news
release:
In the wake of historic wildfires in Oregon, Idaho, California, Washington and
across the West, U.S. Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., Jim Risch, R-Idaho, Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Michael Bennet,
D-Colo., introduced an updated version of their bipartisan wildfire funding
solution that would protect desperately needed funding for fire prevention and
treat wildfires as the natural disasters they are.


The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act of 2017 would end the destructive cycle of
borrowing from fire prevention accounts to put out fires and stop the erosion of
the Forest Service's budget by reforming the way the federal government funds
wildfires.
"Oregonians and westerners are battling another record-breaking fire year. The
threat of catastrophic wildfires is growing, yet the federal government
continues to conduct 'business as usual' when it comes to fighting fires in
Oregon and the West," Wyden said. "More communities are put in danger and fire
prevention work gets left undone because of a backwards fire budgeting system.
It's past time for Congress to make it a top priority to end fire borrowing,
stop the erosion of the Forest Service becoming the 'Fire Service' and start
treating wildfires like the natural disasters they are."
"If you live in a community in the western United States, you do not need to be
told that wildfires are major natural disasters," Crapo said. "With over eight
million acres burned, ten states choked with smoke, and lives and structures
lost, this year's fire season is a brutal reminder that we must start treating
mega fires as the disasters that they are. Now is the time to both recognize
that fires are major disasters and end the destructive cycle of fire borrowing
that only makes the fire situation in this country worse."
"Wildfires have already burned millions of acres this year across the West, and
the fire season is far from over. It's long past time we treat wildfires like
other natural disasters and allow federal agencies to pay for them like other
natural disasters," Feinstein said. "Our bipartisan bill would end the need for
so-called 'fire borrowing,' where funding for fire prevention efforts is
diverted to fighting wildfires, delaying or canceling critical prevention work.
We must empower federal agencies with the tools they need to protect public
safety and get ahead of what could be yet another catastrophic fire year."
 "The West is on fire, and it's burning faster than years prior," Risch said.
"We need every resource available to prevent and combat the devastation caused
by wildfires. This legislation would ensure those of us in the West can count on
much-needed disaster funding."
"Fifty percent more acres have already burned this year than normal and the
trends of the last few years suggest this will likely be our new normal,"
Cantwell said. "The bill we are introducing today will stop the fire-borrowing
that is currently crippling the Forest Service."
"Wildfires continue to decimate Western communities, ruining sources of drinking
water, destroying property, and even claiming lives. Wildfires have all the
qualities of a natural disaster, and it's time that the federal government treat
them as such," Hatch said. "This critical legislation gives much-needed relief
to the Forest Service by putting an end to funding requirements that make it all
but impossible for the agency to bear the increased costs of wildfire
suppression. Ultimately, our bipartisan proposal will leave the Forest Service
better prepared to fight forest fires and better equipped to prevent them from
happening in the first place. It is imperative that we to return to a more
balanced approach to forest management, not just fire management. I am confident
that this bill will help foster safer, healthier forests in Utah and across the
West for years to come."
"The way we fund wildfire suppression today is counterproductive and crazy,"
Merkley said. "As this fire season has proven all too vividly, robbing from
forest health and fire prevention programs to pay for suppression only creates a
vicious cycle of bigger and bigger fires. It's time to fix this problem once and
for all by funding fighting the biggest wildfires the way we do other natural
disasters."
"It may not be getting headlines in the national news, but wildfires have burned
millions of acres in the West this year and the communities impacted in Colorado
need assistance," Gardner said. "I've been working to advance this legislation
to stop fire borrowing for several years, and I appreciate the strong bipartisan
support to ensure the Forest Service has the funds it needs for clean-up and
prevention efforts while also finally requiring the government to treat
wildfires like it does other natural disasters."
"Catastrophic wildfires continue to plague the West, not only threatening
communities and livelihoods but also draining the Forest Service budget," Bennet
said. "We need to restructure the way we pay for fighting catastrophic fires to
mitigate and prevent future wildfires. This bill would end the practice of fire
borrowing--a necessary step that will enable the Forest Service to make
responsible investments on the front end to restore our forests and safeguard
our watersheds."
Unlike for other natural disasters, where agencies can draw from an emergency
fund to pay for disaster response, the U.S. Forest Service and Interior
Department do not have access to disaster funds and are forced to "fire borrow"
- or steal money from fire prevention and other important programs already
funded in their agencies to pay to put out fires.
Currently, federal agencies calculate wildfire suppression budgets based on the
average costs of wildfire suppression over the past 10 years. But as fire
seasons grow longer and wildfires have become more expensive to fight, Congress
is forced to appropriate more funding to an outdated budgeting system that
almost always underestimates the actual cost of fighting fires.
The updated bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would fund wildfires as
natural disasters and protect the agencies' fire prevention budgets by putting a
freeze on the rising budget costs of the 10-year average. It would end "fire
borrowing" by allowing the agencies to fund any fire suppression spending needed
above the frozen average through disaster funding just like other agencies can
access disaster funding for tornadoes, hurricanes and floods.
Making disaster funding available after the appropriated fire suppression funds
are spent would allow the Forest Service to use its fire prevention funding for
its intended purpose - completing hazardous fuels reduction projects that have
been shown to help break the cycle of increasingly dangerous and costly fires.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that this year has been
the single most expensive fire year on record, with fire suppression activities
totaling more than $2 billion. Addressing the current, problematic system of
wildfire funding is part of a larger need to stabilize and update emergency
spending for all natural disasters.

Fire season a fizzle for Whitecourt and region

BYLINE: Peter Shokeir, Whitecourt Star

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A26

LENGTH: 442  words


The Whitecourt region experienced a largely uneventful fire season this year
thanks to wet weather, strong enforcement and vigilant residents, according to
Alberta Wildfire.

Shannon Stambaugh, a wildfire information officer with Alberta Agriculture and
Forestry, said the area had 28 wildfires that burned 11.43 hectares with the
largest singular fire being eight hectares in size. This was below the five-year
average of 58 wildfires burning 184.06 hectares.

"It was a quieter year for the Whitecourt Forest Area," Stambaugh said. "No
communities were threatened by any of these wildfires. Our firefighters were
always busy, helping out around the province or staying in the Forest Area to
carry out normal duties."

This year was wetter in the spring compared to previous years, Stambaugh said,
adding that the region typically sees many wildfires between March and May.

"We also had help from many people out working and enjoying the forest who took
the time to prevent wildfires or helped to report them," she said.

Many residents also called in to get fire permits. Stambaugh said the province
issued almost 80 permits for people in the surrounding forest area this year.
The Whitecourt Fire Department, meanwhile, is responsible for issuing permits
within town boundaries.

"Fire permits help our firefighters know where there is planned burning on the
landscape so they are free to (fight) real wildfires and not end up in someone's
backyard while they are having a cooking or warming fire," she said.

Other areas of Alberta were busier fighting wildfires, such as High Level, Slave
Lake and Rocky Mountain House, Stambaugh said, adding that British Columbia had
an exceptionally active year.

The Calgary Forest Area was also extremely hot and dry until the last few weeks
of the fire season, resulting in a fire ban and off-highway vehicle prohibition
that evolved into a full forest closure, Stambaugh said.

Firefighters within the Whitecourt area went to help these neighboring
communities.

"Our firefighters were kept busy by responding to wildfires here in our forest
area and then going to help other forest areas in the province, B.C. and Montana
when possible," Stambaugh said.

At the end of each season, Alberta Wildfire does an internal review to find out
what areas need improvement when dealing with wildfires. Stambaugh said one
recent improvement was regulation changes that reinforced the province's
commitment to preventing human-caused wildfires and wildfire damage.

"At times, we have found there needed to be improvements and then we took
action," Stambaugh said. "This year will be no different."

Verisk Insurance Solutions Expands Its FireLine Wildfire Risk Management Service
to Three New States

LENGTH: 477  words

DATELINE: New Jersey


Verisk Analytics has issued the following news release:

Property-specific wildfire risk scores now available for Montana, Oklahoma, and
Wyoming JERSEY CITY, N.J., May 4, 2015 -- Verisk Insurance Solutions, a leading
source of information about property/casualty insurance risk, announces the
addition of Montana, Oklahoma, and Wyoming to its FireLine[TM] wildfire risk
management service. Powered by Verisk Climate, FireLine provides the detailed,
up-to-date information insurers need to analyze wildfire risk at the individual
address level. Verisk Insurance Solutions is a Verisk Analytics (Nasdaq:VRSK)
business. FireLine uses advanced satellite data to assess the effects of the
three primary factors that contribute to wildfire risk: fuel, slope, and road
access. Fuel represents the vegetation surrounding the property, slope refers to
the grade of the land upon which the property is built, and road access
identifies potential barriers for firefighters to protect the property. For each
address, FireLine provides a score for each primary risk factor and an overall
wildfire hazard score. "Even though it's difficult to predict precisely when and
where wildfires will strike, insurers can better manage risk by knowing the
relative wildfire risk of properties they insure," said Steve Lekas, vice
president of property underwriting products at Verisk Insurance Solutions.
"FireLine helps insurers manage wildfire risk at individual risk and aggregate
risk levels.  And several state departments of insurance have acknowledged use
of FireLine scores in segmenting pricing." According to a FireLine wildfire risk
analysis, at least 30 percent of all households in Oklahoma and Wyoming are at
moderate to high risk of wildfire losses. In Montana, it's more than 50 percent.
"Working closely with insurers, we recognized the need to bring our leadership
in satellite sensing and weather technologies to wildfire risk assessment in
these new states," said Arindam Samanta, Ph.D., senior manager of underwriting
products and analytics at Verisk Climate. With the new additions, FireLine is
now available for 13 states. Additionally, FireLine data is used to produce
state wildfire risk reports -- a summary of the number of households exposed to
wildfire risk -- for the three new states, Montana, Oklahoma and Wyoming, as
well as for the ten original states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho,
Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Washington. The 2015 reports for
all 13 FireLine states are expected to be publicly available later in May.
FireLine is part of the LOCATION® suite of property products that provides
accurate, essential data on every U.S. property to help insurers assess risk
effectively and make sound underwriting decisions.

Fall wildfire season begins October 15

BYLINE: Clinch Valley Times staff

LENGTH: 539  words


Daylight is getting shorter; nights are getting cooler. Sure, summer has
officially ended, but more importantly, fall wildfire season is here! And
officials with the Virginia Department of Forestry want to keep you and your
family safe from the ravages of wildfire.

"While Virginia's most active wildfire season is typically in spring, fall can
be just as busy," said John Miller, VDOF's director of resource protection. "We
didn't have a lot of rain this summer, and the dead leaves are starting to drop
from the trees. This 'leaf litter' is an abundant source of fuel for wildfires,
which can spread rapidly during dry and windy days."

With more than 62 percent of Virginia's land base (15.8 million acres) being
forested, there are almost 360,000 homes and more than 1 million Virginians
living in areas defined as woodland communities. "That's a lot of lives and
property at risk due to wildfire," Miller said.

State Forester Bettina Ring said, "Preventing a wildfire from ever starting is
critical to the safety and security of our citizens. And, since most wildfires
(96 percent) in Virginia are caused by human activity, if people are careful and
pay attention to weather conditions, they can keep themselves and their property
safe by not letting a wildfire start.";

VDOF fire records go back nearly 100 years (the agency was created in 1914 and
began battling wildfires in 1916.) Of the 140,000 wildfires fought by the
agency, most were caused by people burning their trash or yard debris.

Ring said, "For many people, there are debris-burning alternatives, such as
composting and mulching. But for those who have to burn, we urge them to take
precautions before igniting those fires."

Precautions include: clearing the burn spot and surrounding area down to mineral
soil; keeping the burn pile small; having tools like a shovel or a rake on hand;
ensuring a charged water hose or other water source is at the ready; having a
working cell phone with you so that you can call 911 as soon as the fire escapes
your control, and remaining with the fire until it's completely out. You must
also check the weather conditions in your area before you start to burn. If it's
been several days since it's rained, humidity levels are low and the winds are
higher than 10 miles per hour, wait until conditions improve; otherwise, it's
quite likely your fire will become a wildfire.

Miller said, "If a fire does escape a person's control or is left unattended,
that person is. financially liable for the cost of suppressing the wildfire as
well as any damage that occurs as a result. Depending on the size and complexity
of the wildfire, suppression costs alone could range from several hundred
dollars to tens of thousands of dollars. Add to that the cost of burning down
your neighbor's home or barn, and you could be looking at millions of dollars.
Is it really worth all that just to burn some trash?"

Firefighting is dangerous and physically demanding work. Ring said, "In recent
years, several Virginians have died trying to battle the wildfires they started.
It's much better to dial 911 right away and let the trained wildland
firefighters respond and suppress those fires."

Fall wildfire season runs from Oct. 15 through Nov. 30 each year.

Group warns of more unhealthy smoke from increased wildfires

BYLINE: John Myers, Duluth News Tribune

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 507 words


Oct. 24--As huge swathes of Australia burn in wildfires spurred by drought,
health experts in the U.S. warned Thursday that more heat and more fires means
more unhealthy air to breathe.

The Natural Resources Defense Council released a list of 31 states -- including
Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa -- that saw air quality degraded in 2011 because
of smoke from wildfires, some of them within the state and others far away.

The report concluded that climate change is spurring more heat, more drought and
more wildfires that are leading to unhealthy air.

"Even if you don't live near wildfires your health may be affected by their
smoke,'' Kim Knowlton, a senior scientist with NRDC's Health and Environment
Program, said in a teleconference Thursday.

The NRDC report, using 2011 data, ranked Texas as the state with the most people
exposed to a week or more of bad air from wildfire smoke. Minnesota ranked 20th,
with 15,000 people exposed to nearby smoke and some 1.6 million people affected
by distant smoke. Wisconsin ranked 23rd and Iowa 10th.

In 2011, fueled by a dry summer and drought that lingered into autumn, several
major wildfires burned across northern Minnesota, including the Pagami Creek
fire in the Superior National Forest, the state's largest wildfire in at least
80 years. Smoke from that fire was tracked as far away as Chicago.

The study found some 212 million people across the nation were exposed to
wildfire smoke in 2011. The NRDC said it was the first time the health effects
of wildfire smoke had been mapped using satellite data from the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.

Wildfire smoke contains dozens of toxic compounds, but it's fine particles that
can enter lungs that are the most problematic, said Dr. Patrick L. Kinney,
professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University's Mailman
School of Public Health.

Kinney said smoke from fires hundreds, even thousands of miles away may be an
issue. In northern Minnesota, for example, residents often report smelling smoke
from distant fires in Canada.

"If you can smell it ... or see the haze, I'd be concerned from a health point
of view,'' Kinney told the News Tribune. "Even globally, fine particulate matter
can move thousands of miles."

The health experts urged fast action to limit greenhouse gas emissions and slow
climate change to cut back on the number of wildfires that are spurred by long
hot and dry weather patterns some experts say are linked to climate change. They
said there is no system to track how many people have become ill from wildfire
smoke, or deaths related to smoke exposure.

Other states with large populations in areas affected by smoky conditions for a
week or more include Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New
Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee.

Senator adds wildfire info to website

BYLINE: Staff report

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 271 words


In an effort to help New Mexicans prepare for wildfire season, U.S. Sen. Martin
Heinrich is encouraging residents to visit the Wildfire Preparedness &
Prevention Resource Center on his website, which includes a public service
announcement, as well as active wildfire information, prevention tips and best
practices to protect homes and businesses.

"Wildfire season is here, which means it's more important than ever for each of
us to do our part to protect our communities from unintended fires," Heinrich, a
Democrat from New Mexico, said. "Learning about wildfire danger and being
prepared can help reduce the threat of fires to our natural surroundings, our
homes, and our businesses. I encourage all New Mexicans to visit my website for
tips to help you and your family prepare for wildfire season."

A member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Heinrich is an
advocate for wildfire funding reform and wildfire prevention programs in New
Mexico, including hazardous fuel reduction, stewardship contracting, and
watershed restoration. He is a cosponsor of S.B.326, the Stewardship End Result
Contracting Improvement Act, a bill to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire.
The bill would make it easier for federal land managers and businesses to
partner on long-term, large-scale forest treatment. He also is a cosponsor of
S.B.235, the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act of 2015, which would treat the
largest fires, about 1 percent of annual fires, as natural disasters, and fund
fire fighting efforts from a disaster account similar to the one that funds
hurricane and other natural disaster relief efforts.

More wildfires in Chitwan than other districts

LENGTH: 642 words

DATELINE: KATHMANDU


KATHMANDU, April 12 -- In what looks like a growing threat to endangered species
of Chitwan National Park (CNP), wildfires continue to rage through Nepal's
oldest protected area.

Chitwan, nearly half of its area covered by CNP, has always had to deal with
higher number of wildfire incidents than any other district of Nepal over the
last few weeks. In the last four days, between April 9 and 12, wildfires have
been detected in as many as 277 places, 49 of which are in Chitwan district
alone.

On Saturday, wildfires raged through as many as 76 places of the country, 15 of
which were detected just in Chitwan district. Most of wildfires detected in
Chitwan are inside the CNP, which is a habitat of endangered animals like Royal
Bengal Tigers and one-horned Rhinoceros beside scores of threatened species.

Since April 9, a system jointly developed by the Ministry of Forest and Soil
Conservation (MoFSC) and the International Center for Integrated Mountain
Development (ICIMOD) has traced over 10 wildfires in Chitwan every single day.
No other district than Chitwan, except Nawalparasi for one day, has had to deal
with more than 10 wildfires in a single day. In other districts, even in the
Tarai belt, relatively lesser numbers of wildfires have been detected in this
period.

Although wildfires have not evidently affected big wild animals like tigers,
rhinoceros and elephants until now, the CNP authorities admit that threatened
species like reptiles and butterflies must be under a serious threat caused by
raging forest fires. "We are aware of threats from wildfires," said Kamal Jung
Kunwar, chief warden of the CNP. "But, we are ill-equipped to deal with them."

About a month ago, CNP was provided with a vehicle and a set of fire-fighting
tools, which the MoFSC received from the Japan government. In 2010, the Japan
government had pledged a grant to the Nepal government for protecting forests
from wildfires. Under the Rs 460 million-grant, the MoFSC has received 53
vehicles and 120 sets of fire-fighting tools, which have been distributed among
national parks, district forest offices (DFOs) and several forestry departments.
"The CNP area is too large for us to control forest fires with just one vehicle
and one set of equipments," said Kunwar. "In addition, we lack a clear strategy,
too."

According to Kunwar, most of wildfires detected inside the CNP are ignited by
the local villagers who go into the wood to collect fuel-wood and leaves. "They
are unaware of consequences of wildfires," says he. "When fires break out in the
thick forest, far-flung from our headquarters and security posts, it would be
very difficult for us to get there and control them on time."

Kunwar said they are also carrying out 'controlled burning', which is a
scientific way of grassland management and forest preservation. "All fires
detected inside the CNP may not be hazardous since some of them are results of
controlled burning," said he.

However, forest fire management experts say it is not right time for
control-burning. "Controlled burning is necessary; but it should have been done
between January and February," said Sundar Sharma, coordinator of Regional South
Asia Wildlife Fire Network. "April is the peak season for forest fires. At this
time, forests are very dry and even controlled burning could lead to disastrous
incidents."

Forest fires claim human lives, destroy hundreds of acres of forest area, cause
damages to endangered wild animals, threatened species and flora and fauna every
year. However, the MoFSC has still not set up a unit under it to tackle forest
fires - something envisioned in the national strategy for forest fire
management. "

Wildfire prevention raises fire safety awareness

BYLINE: Austin Daily Herald, Minn.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 348 words


April 19--Recent rain and snow throughout the state has temporarily decreased
Minnesota's wildfire danger rating, but that could quickly change without
adequate rain, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources said.

As part of Wildfire Prevention Week, April 15 through 21, the DNR is encouraging
people to make a special effort to control their fires.

"Most wildfires occur in the spring, between the time when snow melts and
vegetation turns green," said Larry Himanga, DNR wildfire prevention
coordinator. "This spring's wildfire season started earlier than normal, and
fires have been burning with greater intensity. Severe fire conditions have put
a strain on our wildland firefighters and fire departments."

So far this year, the Minnesota DNR has recorded 533 fires that have burned
14,613 acres. Local and federal agencies also have responded to several fires in
their own jurisdictions.

On average, DNR firefighters respond to more than 1,500 wildfires each year. In
Minnesota, 98 percent of wildfires are caused by people, and the number one
reason is escaped debris-burning fires.

Himanga encourages landowners to find alternatives to burning debris, such as
chipping or composting. This is especially true for landowners affected by last
July's blowdown storms in east-central Minnesota and western Wisconsin.

Landowners who wish to burn should check burning restrictions in their areas.
Much of Minnesota is under burning restrictions between now and green up. In
those areas where burning is allowed, be sure to obtain a burning permit, be
careful with debris fires, and remember that piled debris can hold hot coals for
several days to several months.

Visit mndnr.gov/forestry/fire/firerating_restrictions.html for current statewide
fire danger information and burning restrictions. Burning permits can be
obtained from local fire wardens, forestry offices or by visiting mndnr.gov/
forestry/fire/questions.html.

Bemidji selected for national program to help reduce wildfire risks, costs

BYLINE: The Bemidji Pioneer, Minn.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 270 words


Oct. 15--BEMIDJI -- The city of Bemidji has been named one of five new
communities nationwide to receive technical assistance through a national
program aimed at reducing wildfire risk and costs.

The Community Planning Assistance for Wildfire program offers support at the
local level, the Bemidji Fire Department said in a release. Bemidji will
collaborate with a team of consultants, including land use planners, foresters,
and risk mapping experts, to develop wildfire planning and regulatory
strategies.

The fire department will work with the Greater Bemidji Area Joint Planning Board
and Minnesota Department of Natural Resources to reduce the risk and impact of
wildfires.

CPAW is a partnership between the Wildfire Planning International and Headwaters
Economics organizations.

"We believe the Bemidji is in an excellent position to benefit from CPAW due to
the community's wildfire risk, future development pressures, anticipated
planning updates, and strong leadership support for this opportunity," said
Molly Mowery, president of Wildfire Planning International, in the release. "Too
often communities have an interest in reducing wildfire risk through land use
planning mechanisms but may lack the capacity or expertise. CPAW provides the
assistance to work toward that outcome."

The CPAW program is funded through a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Forest
Service and

private foundations. More information is available at
www.planningforwildfire.org.

Washington: As Wildfires Ravage Oregon, Support Grows for Ron's Plan to Fix Fire
Funding

LENGTH: 819 words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: Office of the Senator Ron Wyden has issued the following news
release:



 The cost of fighting wildfires has skyrocketed, and so too have growing
concerns over the current system of wildfire funding. The current cycle of
underfunding fire suppression has created a system that forces federal agencies
to dip into fire prevention funding just to fight this year's fires.





 The practice of borrowing fire prevention funds to pay for fire suppression
means the Forest Service has been unable to pay for projects that will prevent
more frequent and severe wildfires in the future.



 To combat this, Ron proposed a wildfire funding bill with Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo
to end the dangerous cycle of raiding fire prevention accounts to fight fires by
funding the largest wildfires like other natural disasters.



 Ron, Sen. Crapo and nine other senators have pledged to work for a real
solution to wildfire funding when the Senate returns next week.



     OPB: USFS Spends $10M Per Day On Wildfires In Oregon



  &ldquo;Nationwide, the agencies spend $150 million per week on fire
suppression. The cost of fighting wildfires has soared. It's now 52 percent of
the Forest Service's budget, Vilsack said. '(It's) the first time in the history
of the Forest Service that we're spending more money for fire suppression than
anything else,' he said.&rdquo;



 Here's a roundup of recent stories on the growing fire funding problem, and the
need to pass Ron's solution:



     The Register Guard: Put end to 'fire borrowing'



  &ldquo;Congress should waste no time passing this legislation, which comes
amid predictions of a catastrophic fire season. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell
and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack recently warned that wildfire-fighting
costs could run hundreds of millions over budget.&rdquo;



     KATU News: Federal and state firefighting coordinators hear dire forecast



 &ldquo;' We will take action; we always have taken action. It will affect some
other program delivery though,' said Jim Pe&ntilde;a, the U.S. Forest Service
Pacific Northwest Regional Forester.



 That can mean taking the ax to forest fire prevention programs.&rdquo;



     Portland Tribune: Wyden, U.S. agriculture secretary to get update on
Western wildfires



  &ldquo;Unless Congress acts, Americans will continue gradually losing the
benefits of our forests -- fewer available campgrounds, erosion polluting our
streams and rivers, lost jobs as timber projects stall, and most ironically and
worryingly, more frequent and more severe wildfires as we loot fire prevention
to pay for the fires burning right now.&rdquo;



     LA Times: As wildfires rage and budgets dwindle, more federal funds sought
for firefighting



  &ldquo;We have a national treasure here, and we want to do a better job of
preserving and protecting that national treasure. We just simply have to have
the resources and the flexibility to do so, and Sen. Wyden's bill will give us
that opportunity.&rdquo;



     Capital Press: Wyden seeks change in Forest Service wildfire budgeting



 &ldquo;Forest and rangeland officials have counted 3,382 fires in Oregon and
Washington since June 1, with 1.4 million acres burned. Three firefighters died
in Washington, and dozens of homes and outbuildings have been destroyed in the
two states. To date, the fires have cost an estimated $370 million to fight,
with nearly 11,000 firefighters deployed. Fire managers have counted nearly
60,000 lightning strikes this summer.&rdquo;



     Coloradoan: U.S. spending $150 million per week on wildfires



 &ldquo;Wyden has introduced legislation that would treat the most severe fires
as natural disasters and use disaster relief funds to fight them. This should
prevent the need to shift money from other uses.&rdquo;



     Spokesman-Review: As wildfire costs continue to rise, Crapo, Wyden, Risch
say it's time to change how firefighting is funded



  &ldquo;The bill, the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, has 16 Senate cosponsors
from both parties and support from 250 organizations; an identical version in
the House, sponsored by Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson, has 124 co-sponsors from both
parties, including lead co-sponsor Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore.&rdquo;



     KTVZ: Wyden secures backing for wildfire funding fix



  &ldquo;'We know that wildfires are going to continue to be a threat, and we
can better prepare for the increasing costs of wildland fire management by
making needed changes that will support the preparation of firefighters and land
managers,' Crapo said in a statement for the record. 'That is why I partnered
with Senator Ron Wyden in introducing legislation, the Wildfire Disaster Funding
Act, to provide for more efficient and effective fire management.'&rdquo;

ENVIRONMENT;
Tickets for wildfire infractions spiked last year: report

DATELINE: VANCOUVER


The number of people fined for violating rules designed to prevent wildfires in
the province spiked last year, with officers handing out three times as many
tickets than a year earlier, according to statistics compiled by the BC Wildfire
Service.

The increased enforcement occurred even as the number of fires caused by humans
decreased slightly, and as the provincial government promised to crack down on
people who violate rules against campfires and other activities, with
significantly higher fines that began in April.

The issue took on a new urgency earlier this week, when wildfire officials said
at least 10 fires currently burning in the province's northeastern region were
likely set deliberately. At the same time, investigators in Alberta have yet to
pinpoint the cause of the massive wildfire that forced the evacuation of Fort
McMurray last week.

In British Columbia last year, 286 tickets were issued under the Wildfire Act,
compared with 95 in 2014. Those numbers haven't been as high since 2010, when
210 tickets were issued during an especially busy wildfire season.

At the same same time, there were 617 human-caused fires last year - about a
third of all fires - compared with 664 in 2014.

The data provided by the BC Wildfire Service did not break down the nature of
the tickets.

In 2012, penalties totalling about $20,000 were issued in seven wildfire cases.
The BC Wildfire Service is still assessing penalties for 19 cases in 2013.

Last month, the B.C. government significantly increased fines for fire-related
infractions in response to a highly damaging 2015 fire season - when 1,836
wildfires burned about 280,000 hectares and cost the province $277-million. A
fire that destroyed 30 homes in the province's Kootenay region was believed to
be caused by humans.

On April 1, the fine for ignoring fire restrictions, such as campfire bans, rose
to $1,100 - an increase of 218 per cent. Failing to properly dispose of burning
substances, such as cigarette butts, will now warrant a ticket of $575.

So far this year, only three tickets have been issued, though the BC Wildfire
Service noted most tickets are issued during the peak of fire season in July and
August.

In addition to the fines, anyone responsible for starting a wildfire can also be
fined for the cost of fighting the blaze. The punishment for causing a wildfire
includes a fine as high as $100,000 or up to one year in jail.

Forests Minister Steve Thomson declined an interview request, as did the BC
Wildfire Service. The ministry and the agency issued statements saying they hope
the increased fines and greater emphasis on prevention and enforcement will help
to lower the number of humancaused fires.

Earlier this year, as he introduced legislation to impose the new fines, Mr.
Thomson said officials encountered "irresponsible" behaviour last year,
including from people he said were interfering with the work of firefighters.

"At many points last year, our firefighting resources were stretched to the
limits," he told a news conference in March.

While the province issues tickets to people caught in risky behaviour,
determining who is responsible for a major wildfire can be difficult.

After a fire in Barriere, north of Kamloops, caused millions of dollars in
damage in 2003, Michael Barre was found guilty of accidentally starting the
blaze and was fined $3,000. The same year, a Kamloops resident was also found to
have started a fire, and was ordered to pay the Forests Ministry $10,000 in
restitution, in addition to a fine of $1,150.

The BC Wildfire Service said there were 37 active fires in the province as of
Wednesday. Since the beginning of April, a total of 228 fires have burned up
nearly 78,000 hectares. Currently, the largest fire covers 59,000 hectares and
straddles the British Columbia-Alberta border. A number of residents in the area
were briefly under an evacuation order, but are now under an evacuation alert.

Now Is The Time To Address Wildfire Mitigation Near Communities

BYLINE: San Miguel Basin Forum staff

LENGTH: 289  words


With Colorado's snowpack at only 65 percent of average and Red Flag Warnings
again in effect throughout much of the state today, the Colorado State Forest
Service reminds landowners that there's no better time than now to prepare homes
and communities for wildfire.

"Sometimes the best defense is a good offense," said Mike Lester, state forester
and director of the Colorado State Forest Service. "Long before a fire arrives,
landowners should be taking pre-emptive actions to reduce wildfire potential."

The CSFS offers free guides for protecting property from wildfire, including
those that cover FireWise building construction and tips for protecting homes by
maintaining wildfire-defensible zones. The agency also offers site visits with
homeowners to discuss concerns, and works with communities to address mitigation
and wildfire threats on a larger scale through the development of Community
Wildfire Protection Plans (CWPPs).

"Homeowners and communities bear the ultimate responsibility to help protect
themselves and their property from the threat of wildfire," said Courtney
Peterson, Colorado's wildfire mitigation education coordinator.

"Taking simple steps now can help make homes more defensible and help protect
residents and firefighters."

Peterson said some of the critical concerns to reduce the risks presented by
early season, wind-driven wildfires include cutting and removing dead grasses
and weeds; raking up thick beds of pine needles; and keeping gutters, decks and
roofs free of pine needles and other combustibles.

State publications, guidelines and other information on wildfire mitigation and
developing CWPPs are available at CSFS district offices or online at

CRAWFORD SEEKS FIREFIGHTING FUNDS

BYLINE: BILL RUFTY The Ledger

SECTION: News; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 637 words


TALLAHASSEE -- Florida's woods and fields are much drier, much earlier this year
than last year when the state experienced a record number of wildfires,
Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford warned Thursday.

Crawford announced the creation of an arson task force and a public service
campaign explaining what citizens can do to prevent wildfires. The campaign
begins Monday.

In the meantime, Crawford quietly is trying to muster Legislative support for
his all-but-ignored request for $ 37 million with which to fight fire outbreaks.

He has received a $ 1.3 million grant from Gov. Jeb Bush's office and promises
of more support.

The Division of Forestry's fire fighting units have been put on alert and the
U.S. Department of Agriculture has moved a tanker aircraft to the airport in
Brooksville.

The multiple steps are being taken in preparation for another bad fire year.

"We expect that it could be as bad as last year based on he early trends,"
Crawford said. "Our major concern is the threat of wildfire arson and that will
not be tolerated."

From May through July last year, 2,500 wildfires, which burned more than 500,000
acres, were reported in the state.

The fires caused $ 400 million in timber losses alone, destroyed or damaged 300
homes, caused the evacuation of 130,000 residents and drew down on fire fighting
resources from throughout the state and the Florida National Guard.

Already this year, Florida has recorded 1,650 wildfires that have burned 35,000
acres. About a third of those fires, Crawford estimated, have been caused by
arson.

Polk County recorded 91 wildfires with 7,374 acres burned from May to July.

"Wildfire season is coming early," Crawford said. "There has been a rainfall
shortage in almost every county this year. We are preparing for a very tough
year."

In connection with the wildfire arson task force, the Division of Forestry under
the Department of Agriculture has created an arson hot line at 800-342-5869.

"Whoever is responsible, for whatever the reasons, must and will be stopped, "
Crawford said. "We will devote whatever resources are needed to do this.

"Already this year we have arrested one man on multiple felonies in connection
with wildfires in the Sarasota-Manatee area," Crawford said, referring to the
arrest of Jason Derosiers, a 20-year-old North Port man.

In 1998 the department's agriculture law enforcement division arrested 20 people
charging them with wildfire arson. Two arrests have been made this year.

Crawford said the task force and other law enforcement agencies also are
investigating gang-related wildfire arson.

"We have been getting reports of young people setting fires as part of a gang's
initiation process," Crawford said. "This is no child's play. If someone is
killed in such fires, that is murder."

Crawford has requested $ 37 million for improved fire fighting equipment
including two new helicopters along with ground vehicles.

But the Florida Senate only has $ 11 million, and the House approved only $ 6
million in additional fire-fighting equipment.

But with the governor supporting the preparations for what could be another
ravaging wildfire season, Crawford said he is confident he will get most of the
money he needs.

Last year's wildfires, he said, touched almost every one of Florida's 67
counties in the three months that heat and out of control fires plagued the
state.

Alachua County had 35 wildfires in the three-month 1998 fire season with 6,799.5
acres burned.

Marion County had 56 wildfires last summer with 1,029 acres burned.

At the height of the 1998 wildfire season, May through July, Charlotte County
recorded 69 wildfires that destroyed 2,095 acres, Sarasota County had 53 fires
that burned 772 acres and Manatee County lost 203 acres to 13 wildfires.

Wildfire season to start March 1; Alberta's get-ready-early approach follows
last year's costly toll

DATELINE: EDMONTON


Alberta is starting its wildfire season a month early after flames last year
torched almost 5,000 square kilometres.

Forestry Minister Oneil Carlier says the extra time provided with the March 1
launch will ensure that crews are recruited, trained and positioned to respond
quickly to any wildfires that break out in early spring and through the year.

Carlier said the province is already considering how the mild, dry winter will
affect the fire threat in the forest zone.

"While it is difficult to predict what weather conditions will be like in the
weeks and months ahead, we know right now that there has been below-average snow
and rainfall across much of Alberta over the past few months," Carlier said
Tuesday.

"We will continue to monitor the situation and be ready to respond if and when
we are needed."

Alberta's get-ready-early approach comes from painful experience.

The province has been starting its wildfire season a month early since the year
after the May 2011 fire that destroyed part of the town of Slave Lake and forced
thousands of people from their homes.

Last year, there were 1,786 wildfires in Alberta - more than twice the 25-year
average. Crews managed to contain 93 per cent of them within about a day and
prevented flames from entering any communities.

The cost wasn't cheap. Alberta spent $474 million on firefighting last year.

Carlier said it is prudent to be prepared.

"It really gives us a leg up on what we anticipate might be again a very busy
fire season."

Hot, dry weather also made 2015 a bad year for wildfires in Saskatchewan and
British Columbia. Fires north of Prince Albert, Sask., forced about 13,000
people from their homes and burned 17,000 square kilometres of timber. The
government's response to the fires cost about $100 million.

Saskatchewan normally starts its wildfire season on April 1. This year the
province plans to bring some aircraft and crews into service earlier than usual
to ensure full preparation for the 2016 season.

"The Ministry of Environment will be ready to respond to wildfires when the
season starts," said Denis Renaud of Saskatchewan's wildfire management branch.

"With generally warmer temperatures and below-normal snowfall over much of the
northern half of Saskatchewan so far this winter, the ministry is preparing for
the possibility of an early start to the coming wildfire season."

The results of a review into how Saskatchewan handled the 2015 wildfire season
are to be made public soon, he said.

B.C. recorded more than 1,836 wildfires last year that burned 2,804 square
kilometres. The firefighting bill was estimated at $290 million.

The province starts its wildfire season in May. An official said it is too early
to predict how weather conditions will affect B.C. forests this year.

There were so many wildfires last year that the three provinces brought in crews
from other countries to help out. Saskatchewan also called in Canadian Army
units. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2016 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved.

Smallest increase in temperature could lead to significant rise in wildfire
activity

BYLINE: Natalia Hall

LENGTH: 337  words


Researchers from University of Wyoming have clearly warned that even a slightest
rise in average temperature could lead to a significant rise in wildfire
incidents that are already garnering attention in the Western United States.

Due to global warming, we can witness a new era of high-elevation wildfires that
have not been seen in over 1,000 years. More than 50,000 wildfires have happened
this year and those blazes have destroyed more than 9 million acres in the West
and Alaska in 2015.

Experts think warming in Alaska is the main reason behind huge wildfires there.
The research paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences has unveiled that even a small amount of wildfire could have a massive
effect on wildfire.

Study researchers have studied charcoal samples representing 2,000 years of
wildfire taken from lake beds in a subalpine forest in northern Colorado's Mount
Zirkel Wilderness near Steamboat Springs. Through this, the researchers were
able to measure the increased wildfire frequency in a period of global warming
that was similar to current conditions.

The period was Medieval Climate Anomaly that was around 1,100 to 1,200 years
back. "Our study then adds more evidence that the recent increase in large
wildfires is related to climate change because the only time we see these types
of large wildfires in the last 2,000 years is when we had a similar amount of
warming", said John Calder, study's lead researcher.

"This is real evidence things burned more. We're not speculating," said Bryan
Shuman, a co-author and geology and geophysics professor at UW. "We're showing
things really happened. It really was warmer here and when that happened, there
were more fire."

"Our question was, 'How sensitive is wildfire to climate change,' and this
suggests, and other people have shown this too, we see that fire is very
sensitive, particularly to temperature," Calder said. "Small temperature
increases, less than 1 degree Fahrenheit, can lead to huge amounts of burning on
a landscape."

Washington: Bennet, Crapo, Tester, Risch Introduce Bill to Provide Resources for
Fire Mitigation Work

LENGTH: 1085  words



 Washington: Office of the Senator Jim Risch has issued the following news
release:



 Today, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet, Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID), Senator
Jon Tester (D-MT), and Senator Jim Risch (R-ID) introduced The Wildfire
Mitigation Assistance Act to provide more funding to mitigate the effects of
wildfires and prevent future fires. The bill treats wildfires in the same manner
as other natural disasters by allowing Hazard Mitigation Assistance funding to
be provided to states affected by catastrophic wildfires that have received Fire
Management Assistance Grants (FMAG).





 Currently, hazard mitigation funding to lessen the effects of a future disaster
can only be provided to states after the President declares a major disaster.
However, unlike in the case of hurricanes, floods, or tornados, most wildfires
do not receive a major disaster declaration. Instead, wildfires are paid for
using FMAG funding and do not receive funding for mitigation efforts to prevent
the next wildfire. Wildfire mitigation efforts are proven to reduce the costs
and long-term effects of wildfires on communities, properties, and watersheds.



 "Throughout the west, we have seen an increase in wildfires like the ones
burning across Colorado right now that are destroying property and habitats and
resulting in the tragic loss of life," Bennet said. "We can dramatically reduce
the severity and damage caused by fires through mitigation work. For every
dollar we spend on mitigation efforts like reducing fuel loads, there is an
average savings of four dollars in recovery spending. Our bill will treat fires
like other natural disasters by providing post-fire mitigation funding to
affected communities."



 "The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)spends a good deal of money
every year helping communities at risk of natural disasters prepare for
disasters such as flood preparation for hurricanes or modification to houses in
Tornado Alley," said Crapo. "However, FEMA spends very little money assisting
communities at risk of being impacted by wildfires. Our legislation would
address that disparity by allowing fire-prone communities apply for Hazard
Mitigation grants to undertake 'fire-wise' projects for homes in the wildland
urban interface or reduce hazardous fuels."



 "We have seen the catastrophic impacts of wildfires across Montana and the west
and we must do more to prevent them and reduce their devastation," Tester said.
"We know that a wildfire doesn't end when the flames stop burning. This bill
will provide additional resources to restore land after a wildfire sweeps
through, preventing future disasters."



 "Although many of my eastern colleagues do not fully appreciate the situation,
wildfires continue to wreak havoc in the western part of our country and this
continuing threat is very real," said Risch. "The Wildfire Mitigation Assistance
Act will be a longer-lasting, positive solution to the ever-increasing need for
funds to prevent and battle fires."



 "Wildfires threaten the health and safety of communities, contaminate waters,
damage wildlife habitats and impact county economies by reducing opportunities
for jobs and tourism on the land," said National Association of Counties (NACo)
President and El Paso County Commissioner Sallie Clark. "The Wildfire Mitigation
Assistance Act leverages federal, state and local resources to address the
factors that most directly contribute to catastrophic wildfires before they
happen. Counties applaud Senators Bennet, Crapo, and Tester for their leadership
and urge Congress to enact meaningful legislation to reduce wildfire risks and
associated costs for response and recovery, improve the health of federal
forests and ensure the long-term health and viability of our lands and
communities."



 "I applaud Senators Bennet, Tester and Crapo for introducing this important
legislation," said Chief Rhoda Mae Kerr, International Association of Fire
Chiefs President and Chair of the Board. "Even after the wildland fires are
extinguished, communities are still at risk for future floods and landslides.
This legislation will help states and communities mitigate that risk."



 "While we are frequently judged based on response and criticized based on
recovery, mitigation and preparedness are critical phases of emergency
management and they most often occur outside the spotlight," said President of
the U.S. Council of the International Association of Emergency Managers
President Robie Robinson. "As mitigation is the linchpin of emergency
management, expanding hazard mitigation grant funding following a Fire
Management Assistance Grant declaration will enable jurisdictions to implement
programs that will effectively reduce risks and return benefits many fold."



 The Fiscal Year 2015 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill
included a one-year authority to provide hazard mitigation grants following FMAG
declarations. That authority is being used to develop and implement fire
mitigation projects in nine states and one tribe that received FMAG declarations
for wildfires between March and September 2015. This bill would make that
authority permanent. This measure was originally introduced as part of the
PREPARE Act Bennet and Crapo introduced last August.



 This bill has the support of local elected officials, state and local emergency
managers, major fire service organizations, and floodplain managers. The bill is
also supported by the National Association of Counties, the International
Association of Emergency Managers, US Council, the International Association of
Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Fire Fighters, the National
Emergency Management Association, the National Fire Protection Association, the
Association of State Floodplain Managers, and the National Volunteer Fire
Council.



 The Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) Program provides federal funding to
states, local governments, and tribes for firefighting and emergency protective
measures for fires on public or private forests that are considered major
disasters. Funding is currently only available for activities while the fire is
burning.



 The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) provides federal funding to help
communities implement measures in the wake of a Presidential major disaster
declaration to reduce long-term risk to people and property from future natural
disasters.

BC Wildfire Service is expecting smoke from the Kamloops and Cariboo Fire
Centres to drift into the region by tomorrow and is expected to continue moving
through this region, so long as the prevailing winds come from the west and
northwest.

Although the BC Wildfire Service is responding to a number of lightning-caused
wildfires visible to surrounding communities and highways, none of these
wildfires are immediately threatening communities or structures.

These wildfires include the following:

* Two wildfires are burning five kilometres and 11 kilometres northeast of
Galena Bay. These wildfires are one hectare or less, are burning at high
elevation, and are not threatening highway infrastructure; however, they are
visible from Highway 31 and Galena Bay.

* Two small wildfires about one hectare in size, one located about 10 kilometres
west of Kaslo on Mount Carlyle, and another burning northwest of Kootenay Lake
on Windsor Peak, are also burning at high elevation and are not threatening
communities or structures.

* A number of fires are burning in Glacier and Kootenay National Parks. Two
fires located in Glacier National Park are visible from the TransCanada Highway
and one fire in Kootenay National Park in the Verdant Creek area is visible east
of Highway 93. These fires are being managed by the Glacier and Kootenay
National Park Fire Management crews. More information can be found at:
https://www.canada.ca/en/news.html

In the past week, Southeast Fire Centre personnel have responded to 52 wildfires
that have burned 34 hectares. Since April 1, 2017, the Southeast Fire Centre has
responded to 112 wildfires to date burning 117 hectares. Seventy-seven of these
fires were lightning caused while the remaining were human caused and therefore
preventable.

The fire danger rating in the majority of the Southeast Fire Centre is currently
"high," with areas of "extreme" fire danger.

The Southeast Fire Centre extends from the U.S. border in the south to the Mica
Dam in the north and from the Okanagan Highlands and Monashee Mountains in the
west to the B.C.-Alberta border in the east. This includes the Selkirk Natural
Resource District and the Rocky Mountain Natural Resource District.

Helping Communities Prepare For Wildfires

BYLINE: The Julian News staff

LENGTH: 445  words


(NAPSA) - For the nearly 70,000 U.S. communities threatened by wildfires, it
isn't a matter of if, but when fire will be a natural occurrence in their
ecosystem. Wildfires cost billions of dollars each year in suppression costs and
damage to homes, infrastructure, the economy and resources. In addition,
wildfires put both civilian and firefighter lives at risk. But there is help.

The nation's leaders in wildfire mitigation have partnered to develop Fire
Adapted Communities, a prefire strategy to help communities at risk of wildfire
save lives and reduce risk to homes, infrastructure and resources.

The U.S. Forest Service and the National Fire Protection Association partnered
with a coalition of other prominent nonprofit organizations and government
agencies to create the Fire Adapted Communities initiative.

The campaign website, www.Fireadapted.org, provides straightforward information
on national programs, tools and funding sources to help communities at risk from
wildfire prepare for fire before it starts. The program takes a community-based
approach, encouraging homeowners, land managers, civic leaders and first
responders to take proactive steps to make their communities fire adapted.

The Ad Council has partnered with the U.S. Forest Service to help deliver the
Fire Adapted Communities message nationwide. This national public service
advertising campaign raises awareness that those living in fire-prone
communities must prepare in advance to mitigate wildfire damage when it occurs.
The more proactive actions a community takes, the more fire adapted it becomes.

Partnering to Reduce

Wildfire Risk

According to U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell, the campaign will help
individual homeowners and communities safeguard their homes from wildfire
threats. Said Tidwell, "We are pleased to partner with the Ad Council and the
National Fire Protection Association to help educate communities-especially
those next to wooded areas-on simple steps they can take to help protect their
property and families when wildfires strike."

A History of Collaboration

The campaign was created pro bono by advertising agency Draftfcb, which has
worked with the Ad Council and U.S. Forest Service for more than 68 years, to
address the issue of wildfire prevention with the iconic character Smokey Bear
and his famous tagline "Only You Can Prevent Wildfires."

Said Peggy Conlon, president and CEO of the Ad Council, "We hope that our
efforts will influence property owners and community leaders in fire-prone areas
to take the necessary steps to prepare in advance of a wildfire, improving the
safety and resiliency of their communities."

Rising mercury, wind spark wildfires in Udayapur

BYLINE: Himalayan news service

LENGTH: 333  words


Gaighat, March 18: With the onset of dry and windy season, incidents of wildfire
have increased in Udayapur.

Wildfire spread through Hariyali Community Forest in Chaudhandi Municipality-9
at 3:00pm yesterday. Police brought the blaze under control with the support of
locals and employees of the District Forest Office after five hours, said
Udayapur DFO's assistant forest officer Jageswor Sah. Sah said the fire had
destroyed forest spread over 17-hectare land.

A fire fighter from the municipality was used to put out the fire.

Wildfire causes damage worth millions to national and community forests every
year in the district. Though incidents of wildfire are reported frequently in
the district, the forest office and community forest users' groups do little or
nothing to control wildfires in the district.

It was revealed that yesterday's wildfire was the result of human negligence. It
was found that fire broke out in the forest after  cattle grazers made fire out
of dried leaves while they were in the forest to tending livestock. The forest
office, however, has no record of arrest or punishment.

Sah said forests in the district have started catching fire for the past
fortnight. Increasing temperature and the wind spark the wildfire. District
Forest Office spends Rs one million to control wildfire every year, but to no
avail. The money is mostly spent on newspaper advertisements and organising
workshops.

Retired assistant forest officer Raj Kumar Thakur said that only 10 per cent of
the allocated budget was being spent on controlling wildfire incidents. "All
money is pocketed by forest officers. Expenses are shown on paper only, nothing
concrete has been done to control wildfire in the district so far," Thakur said.

Three sectors and 35 area forest offices are under the Forest Office in
Udayapur.

Assistant Forest Officer Sah said that his office had issued directive to all
the unit offices and community forest users' groups to stay alert against
possible incidents of wildfire.

Florida governor declares state of emergency as destructive wildfires rage
across the state

LENGTH: 341  words




Phoenix: Arizona AccuWeather has issued the following news release:
Over 100 wildfires are burning across Florida in what has become the worst
wildfire season in years.
Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency on Tuesday due to the
recent wildfires and high risk for wildfire development in the near future.


"Much of Central and South Florida are approaching drought-like conditions and
the chances for wildfires are continuing to increase with hotter temperatures
and low rainfall," Scott said in a release on April 11.
The latest report from the U.S. Drought Monitor shows that over 42 percent of
Florida is dealing with moderate drought conditions, while 13 percent of the
state is experiencing severe drought.

 This has been the most active season for wildfires in Florida since 2011, with
active fires burning across more than 20,000 acres. These fires are burning all
over the state, including some of the more popular tourist areas.
The fires have destroyed 19 homes, according to the Associated Press.
"From St. George Island in the Panhandle to a wildfire just north of one of the
world's most famous tourist attractions in Orlando, we're seeing that every area
of our state is susceptible to wildfire," Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam
said.
People visiting the Sunshine State should be mindful of the wildfire danger and
may experience reduced visibility and road closures around some of the blazes.

The worst of the smoky conditions will occur during the overnight and early
morning hours as the smoke settles around ongoing fires. Visibility could be
reduced to near zero in these areas, leading to dangerous early morning
commutes.

Idaho: Bennet, Crapo, Tester, Risch Introduce Bill to Provide Resources for Fire
Mitigation Work

LENGTH: 1087  words



 Boise: The Senate Office of James e. Risch of Idaho has issued the following
news release:



 Today, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet, Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID), Senator
Jon Tester (D-MT), and Senator Jim Risch (R-ID) introduced The Wildfire
Mitigation Assistance Act to provide more funding to mitigate the effects of
wildfires and prevent future fires. The bill treats wildfires in the same manner
as other natural disasters by allowing Hazard Mitigation Assistance funding to
be provided to states affected by catastrophic wildfires that have received Fire
Management Assistance Grants (FMAG).





 Currently, hazard mitigation funding to lessen the effects of a future disaster
can only be provided to states after the President declares a major disaster.
However, unlike in the case of hurricanes, floods, or tornados, most wildfires
do not receive a major disaster declaration. Instead, wildfires are paid for
using FMAG funding and do not receive funding for mitigation efforts to prevent
the next wildfire. Wildfire mitigation efforts are proven to reduce the costs
and long-term effects of wildfires on communities, properties, and watersheds.



 "Throughout the west, we have seen an increase in wildfires like the ones
burning across Colorado right now that are destroying property and habitats and
resulting in the tragic loss of life," Bennet said. "We can dramatically reduce
the severity and damage caused by fires through mitigation work. For every
dollar we spend on mitigation efforts like reducing fuel loads, there is an
average savings of four dollars in recovery spending. Our bill will treat fires
like other natural disasters by providing post-fire mitigation funding to
affected communities."



 "The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)spends a good deal of money
every year helping communities at risk of natural disasters prepare for
disasters such as flood preparation for hurricanes or modification to houses in
Tornado Alley," said Crapo. "However, FEMA spends very little money assisting
communities at risk of being impacted by wildfires. Our legislation would
address that disparity by allowing fire-prone communities apply for Hazard
Mitigation grants to undertake 'fire-wise' projects for homes in the wildland
urban interface or reduce hazardous fuels."



 "We have seen the catastrophic impacts of wildfires across Montana and the west
and we must do more to prevent them and reduce their devastation," Tester said.
"We know that a wildfire doesn't end when the flames stop burning. This bill
will provide additional resources to restore land after a wildfire sweeps
through, preventing future disasters."



 "Although many of my eastern colleagues do not fully appreciate the situation,
wildfires continue to wreak havoc in the western part of our country and this
continuing threat is very real," said Risch. "The Wildfire Mitigation Assistance
Act will be a longer-lasting, positive solution to the ever-increasing need for
funds to prevent and battle fires."



 "Wildfires threaten the health and safety of communities, contaminate waters,
damage wildlife habitats and impact county economies by reducing opportunities
for jobs and tourism on the land," said National Association of Counties (NACo)
President and El Paso County Commissioner Sallie Clark. "The Wildfire Mitigation
Assistance Act leverages federal, state and local resources to address the
factors that most directly contribute to catastrophic wildfires before they
happen. Counties applaud Senators Bennet, Crapo, and Tester for their leadership
and urge Congress to enact meaningful legislation to reduce wildfire risks and
associated costs for response and recovery, improve the health of federal
forests and ensure the long-term health and viability of our lands and
communities."



 "I applaud Senators Bennet, Tester and Crapo for introducing this important
legislation," said Chief Rhoda Mae Kerr, International Association of Fire
Chiefs President and Chair of the Board. "Even after the wildland fires are
extinguished, communities are still at risk for future floods and landslides.
This legislation will help states and communities mitigate that risk."



 "While we are frequently judged based on response and criticized based on
recovery, mitigation and preparedness are critical phases of emergency
management and they most often occur outside the spotlight," said President of
the U.S. Council of the International Association of Emergency Managers
President Robie Robinson. "As mitigation is the linchpin of emergency
management, expanding hazard mitigation grant funding following a Fire
Management Assistance Grant declaration will enable jurisdictions to implement
programs that will effectively reduce risks and return benefits many fold."



 The Fiscal Year 2015 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill
included a one-year authority to provide hazard mitigation grants following FMAG
declarations. That authority is being used to develop and implement fire
mitigation projects in nine states and one tribe that received FMAG declarations
for wildfires between March and September 2015. This bill would make that
authority permanent. This measure was originally introduced as part of the
PREPARE Act Bennet and Crapo introduced last August.



 This bill has the support of local elected officials, state and local emergency
managers, major fire service organizations, and floodplain managers. The bill is
also supported by the National Association of Counties, the International
Association of Emergency Managers, US Council, the International Association of
Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Fire Fighters, the National
Emergency Management Association, the National Fire Protection Association, the
Association of State Floodplain Managers, and the National Volunteer Fire
Council.



 The Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) Program provides federal funding to
states, local governments, and tribes for firefighting and emergency protective
measures for fires on public or private forests that are considered major
disasters. Funding is currently only available for activities while the fire is
burning.



 The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) provides federal funding to help
communities implement measures in the wake of a Presidential major disaster
declaration to reduce long-term risk to people and property from future natural
disasters.

PG&E Funds Local Fire Safe Council Projects, Joins CAL FIRE in Urging Residents
to Prevent, Prepare for Wildfires

LENGTH: 508  words


May 4 -- In response to one of the most severe droughts on record, Pacific Gas
and Electric Company (PG&E) announced today it is providing nearly $2 million in
funding to local Fire Safe Councils across its service area for fuel reduction
projects and public education to help prevent dangerous wildfires. PG&E is also
joining CAL FIRE during California Wildfire Awareness Week in urging residents
to prevent and prepare for wildfires. 'Wildfire Awareness Week' is observed
every year during the first week of May.

With the early-April snowpack water content standing at only five percent of
normal, most of California is at risk for devastating wildfires. That's why PG&E
is supporting CAL FIRE's public education campaigns, "One Less Spark, One Less
Wildfire" and "Ready, Set, Go."

"At PG&E, we pride ourselves on being the public's partner in safety. We are
honored to team with firefighters on the important work they do to help educate
Californians about the dangers of wildfires and how to prevent and prepare for
them. We encourage all of our customers and employees to focus on fire safety
now and throughout the entire year," said Barry Anderson, vice president of
emergency preparedness and operations for PG&E.;

"California's wildfire activity has been well above normal all year long and as
we reach the traditional summer months that trend is not likely to go away,"
said Daniel Berlant, CAL FIRE chief of public information. "That's why it is
critical that all residents are prepared for wildfires by maintaining 100 feet
of Defensible Space around their homes, and that all Californians take steps to
prevent sparking a wildfire."

In 2014, PG&E worked with 38 local Fire Safe Councils to fund fire breaks in and
around communities, improve emergency access roads and help low-income residents
clear defensible space around their properties to protect them from fire. PG&E
is proud to continue working closely with local Fire Safe Councils across
northern and central California to ensure that the communities it serves are
prepared for wildfires.

Since the beginning of this year, CAL FIRE already has responded to more than
1,000 wildfires scorching more than 4,100 acres. That's twice as many than in an
average year. Last year, CAL FIRE responded to 5,600 fires which burned 90,000
acres. According to CAL FIRE, more than 90 percent of all wildfires in
California are sparked by people. PG&E is urging its employees and customers to
use caution when operating outdoor equipment, burning debris or campfires, and
to properly maintain and tow vehicles safely. PG&E will help spread the "One
Less Spark, One Less Wildfire" message on its customer billing envelopes this
summer.

In addition to its already extensive vegetation management program, PG&E is
conducting additional aerial and ground inspections around its power lines to
help ensure that trees or limbs do not come into contact with equipment. The
utility is deploying hundreds of tree workers to mitigate fire risks across its
service area.

Washington: Carbajal, Brownley, and Panetta Urge Wildfire Funding Fix in Omnibus
Package

LENGTH: 753  words



Washington: Office of the MP Salud Carbajal has issued the following news
release:

After the most destructive California wildfire season on record, Central Coast
Reps. Salud Carbajal (CA-24), Julia Brownley (CA-26), and Jimmy Panetta (CA-20)
requested that Congress include a fix to the disruptive wildfire budgeting
practice in their must-pass FY 2018 Omnibus Appropriations Bill. The letter
addresses the long-term problem of consistently underfunding fire suppression, a
practice which currently forces federal agencies to steal from fire prevention
and mitigation funds to fight fires, so-called "fire borrowing."
The United States Forest Service (USFS) spent a record $2.4 billion to put out
fires in FY 2018, requiring $527 million in transfers from other mitigation
accounts within the USFS.


"Congress' failure to address this critical budgeting issue forces USFS to delay
maintenance and puts Central Coast families in greater danger," said Rep.
Carbajal. "Properly funding wildfire mitigation on federal lands means saving
more money in the long-term. Our firefighters face longer and more destructive
fire seasons in California, working around the clock to put out fires near our
homes and businesses. We owe them the resources to implement measures that are
proven to help control future wildfires."
"For many years, my colleagues and I have been trying to address the problem of
'fire-borrowing.'" said Rep. Brownley. "We simply must make sure that the U.S.
Forest Service has access to the resources necessary to address wildfire
suppression without having to decimate other programs. I am hopeful this can be
addressed in the upcoming Omnibus, and I am frustrated that Speaker Ryan has not
allowed legislation to fix this problem to come to the floor for a vote."
Carbajal is a cosponsor of bipartisan legislation to fix the way the federal
government funds the fight against wildfires, H.R. 2862, the Wildfire Disaster
Funding Act, which was introduced by Rep. Mike Simpson, a Republican from Idaho.
The bill categorizes wildfire response as a natural disaster, while continuing
to fund routine wildfire costs through the normal budgeting and appropriations
process. Carbajal has also requested an increase to the FY 2019 appropriations
for Wildland Fire Management (WFM) and the Federal Land Assistance, Management
and Enhancement Act (FLAME) accounts.
Both approaches would end the practice of fire borrowing by funding the largest
wildfires from disaster accounts similar to accounts used to fund other natural
disasters, freeing up funding for fire prevention and forest health projects.
Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi:

As you continue to negotiate a final spending bill for the 2018 fiscal year, we
strongly urge you to include language to fix the way Congress funds wildfire
suppression and fuels management efforts. Since 2000, we have seen prolonged
fire seasons with the frequency and size of fires also rising. This has led to
an increase in the amount of spending drastically needed for fire suppression
activities. In turn, the United States Forest Service (USFS) has continuously
exceeded the amount of funds appropriated to fight wildfires, which has come at
the expense of other programs that reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires and
increase the ability of land to recover from these disasters.

This past year alone was the most expensive year on record. The USFS spent a
record $2.4 billion on wildfire suppression, requiring $527 million in transfers
from other accounts within the USFS. While the transfer of funds is generally
repaid in subsequent appropriations bills, this is a disruptive practice that
impedes land management agencies from doing potentially life-saving mitigation
activities that would reduce the risks of wildfires. It means the USFS can't do
prescribed burns, fuels management, or insect control because Congress has
failed to provide a mechanism to adequately fund the agency and provide
certainty for them to move forward with fire mitigation activities.

Unfortunately, the impacts of these wildfires are widespread. In 2017, there
were 14 federal firefighter fatalities. This past year, the Thomas Fire became
the largest fire in California's history--burning nearly 282,000 acres and
triggering mudslides that claimed the lives of 23 individuals.

Again, we ask that any final spending bill for FY18 include language that would
address this issue. We stand ready to provide any assistance. This is a fix that
is overdue and we need to address.

Guest column: Wildfires are national disasters

Congress needs to change the way it pays for fire supression, write U.S. Reps.
Mike Simpson, Kurt Schrader, Ken Calvert and Betty McCollum.

By U.S. Reps. Mike Simpson, Kurt Schrader, Ken Calvert and Betty McCollum

Washington, D.C. - The 2015 wildfire season has been brutal. In mid-August the
National Wildland Fire Preparedness Level was raised to the highest Level 5 and
the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) mobilized active duty military
personnel to fight wildfires for the first time in almost a decade.

Millions of acres are burning in the drought-plagued West - more than twice as
many as last year - and the Forest Service anticipates that suppression costs
will exceed the budget by nearly a half a billion dollars.

The severity of this fire season underscores the fact that our current wildfire
suppression budget process simply does not work. Twenty years ago wildfire
suppression made up about 15 percent of the Forest Service budget. This year it
is over half. This means that the Forest Service spends the majority of its
time, funding, and staff resources putting out fires instead of managing our
nation's public lands.

This situation has reached a crisis point. This is why we have introduced H.R.
167, the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act (WDFA). The WDFA discards the old, broken
model for wildfire suppression and replaces it with one that treats wildfires
like the natural disasters they are.

Today wildfire suppression funding is based primarily on an historical average
of suppression costs over the past 10 years. The 10-year average funding model
worked when the cost of wildfire suppression was relatively stable. But wildfire
suppression costs have steadily grown over the past two decades. Drought,
invasive vegetation, and increasing development near wildland areas increase the
risk of catastrophic fires.

Fire season is longer, fires are more severe, and suppression is more costly-and
these trends are expected to continue. And because suppression costs now
routinely exceed the budget, agencies are continually forced to transfer funding
from non-fire projects to pay them.

Our current path only leads to bigger, more expensive, and more devastating
fires. The WDFA changes directions by treating catastrophic wildfires like other
natural disasters. It continues to use the 10-year average funding model where
it works-for routine wildfire suppression costs-but it makes those few but very
expensive emergency fires eligible for the same disaster spending cap adjustment
as other natural disasters. Catastrophic fires represent only about 1% of all
wildland fires but make up 30 percent of the costs.

The WDFA allows us to finally budget responsibly for wildfire suppression in a
way that ultimately decreases firefighting costs by mitigating fire risk. It
restores the Forest Service's ability to effectively manage our forests, and
with proper management forests will be more resilient to catastrophic fire,
disease, and other threats. And ending the destructive cycle of fire borrowing
means that land management agencies will be more accountable to Congress's
direction.

The fires we experience out west are just as devastating as the hurricanes and
tornadoes that strike the East Coast and Midwest and they should be funded as
such. Westerners have been suffering from this fairness issue and it's high time
that all states be treated the same-with equal access to disaster funding.

As wildfires continue to blaze, Congress has a responsibility to act. Today more
than 130 members of Congress have cosponsored H.R. 167, and that number
continues to grow. The bill is supported by a broad coalition of over 300
organizations who all recognize that the status quo is unsustainable. Fixing the
wildfire budget is the critical first step in making our forests healthier and,
ultimately, reducing the cost of wildfires in the future.

Idaho: Risch, Crapo, Wyden Press Senate Leadership to Include Bipartisan
Wildfire Funding Fix in Upcoming Disaster Aid Legislation

LENGTH: 523  words



Boise: The Senate Office of James e. Risch of Idaho has issued the following
news release:
With deadly fires still raging in California and across the West, a bipartisan
group of senators led by Sens. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, Jim Risch, R-Idaho, Ron
Wyden, D-Oregon, and others today pressed Senate Leaders Mitch McConnell and
Charles E. Schumer in a letter to include a wildfire funding fix in disaster aid
legislation the Senate will soon consider.


In addition to Crapo, Risch, and Wyden, the senators who signed the letter are:
Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
Patty Murray, D-Wash., Michael Bennet, D-Colo., Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Jon
Tester, D-Mont..
The House of Representatives passed disaster aid legislation last week to
provide funding for hurricanes and wildfires that have hit the country this
year. That bill will allow the U.S. Forest Service to pay back the funds it has
been forced to borrow from other accounts to cover the cost of fighting
wildfires. However, the House-passed legislation does not include a long-term
solution to provide consistent funding for fire suppression and prevention.
The bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act (WDFA) would fix the way the
federal government funds and fights wildfires. It would end the practice known
as "fire borrowing" by funding the largest wildfires from disaster accounts
similar to accounts used to fund other natural disasters, freeing up funding for
fire prevention and forest health projects.
"We request that you work with us to include the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act,
legislative language that ensures the U.S. Forest Service and the Department of
Interior (DOI) have stable, reliable funding to help prevent wildfires," the
senators wrote.
So far, the Forest Service and the Interior Department have spent almost $2.9
billion this year to put out wildfires. The Forest Service has had to take funds
from other accounts, or "fire borrow" to pay for the record-breaking cost of
this year's fires.
"Passage of the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act will free up funds to do the
prevention work that reduces the risk of catastrophic wildfires that our country
has suffered this year -- funding that could have prevented the deaths of
Americans, destruction of hundreds of homes and businesses, the loss of business
revenue due to evacuations, and the loss of millions of acres of forests," they
wrote. "We ask that you work with Western senators to include a comprehensive
wildfire funding fix in any disaster supplemental bill that comes before the
Senate."
In September, a similar group of bipartisan senators wrote to the Senate leaders
urging them to include the bipartisan wildfire funding fix in any disaster aid
package that passes through Congress.
Wildfires have burned about 8.7 million acres of land this year, according to
the National Interagency Fire Center. Tens of thousands of residents have been
forced to evacuate from their homes in California this year alone.

Idaho: Risch, Crapo, Wyden Press Senate Leadership to Include Bipartisan
Wildfire Funding Fix in Upcoming Disaster Aid Legislation

LENGTH: 523 words



Boise: The Senate Office of James e. Risch of Idaho has issued the following
news release:
With deadly fires still raging in California and across the West, a bipartisan
group of senators led by Sens. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, Jim Risch, R-Idaho, Ron
Wyden, D-Oregon, and others today pressed Senate Leaders Mitch McConnell and
Charles E. Schumer in a letter to include a wildfire funding fix in disaster aid
legislation the Senate will soon consider.


In addition to Crapo, Risch, and Wyden, the senators who signed the letter are:
Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
Patty Murray, D-Wash., Michael Bennet, D-Colo., Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Jon
Tester, D-Mont..
The House of Representatives passed disaster aid legislation last week to
provide funding for hurricanes and wildfires that have hit the country this
year. That bill will allow the U.S. Forest Service to pay back the funds it has
been forced to borrow from other accounts to cover the cost of fighting
wildfires. However, the House-passed legislation does not include a long-term
solution to provide consistent funding for fire suppression and prevention.
The bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act (WDFA) would fix the way the
federal government funds and fights wildfires. It would end the practice known
as "fire borrowing" by funding the largest wildfires from disaster accounts
similar to accounts used to fund other natural disasters, freeing up funding for
fire prevention and forest health projects.
"We request that you work with us to include the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act,
legislative language that ensures the U.S. Forest Service and the Department of
Interior (DOI) have stable, reliable funding to help prevent wildfires," the
senators wrote.
So far, the Forest Service and the Interior Department have spent almost $2.9
billion this year to put out wildfires. The Forest Service has had to take funds
from other accounts, or "fire borrow" to pay for the record-breaking cost of
this year's fires.
"Passage of the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act will free up funds to do the

Wildfires are making California home insurance unaffordable

BYLINE: Bloomberg

SECTION: Y,Y; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 777 words



HIGHLIGHT: mb "The problem of insurance availability is going to expand" after
last year's record-breaking wildfires, California Insurance Commissioner Dave
Jones said in an interview Thursday. He said growing rates of non-renewal and
rate increases for people in wildfire zones are "entering a critical stage."


More frequent and intense wildfires are making it harder for homeowners to find
and keep insurance in California, a state regulator warned Thursday.

"The problem of insurance availability is going to expand" after last year's
record-breaking wildfires, California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said in
an interview Thursday. He said growing rates of nonrenewal and rate increases
for people in wildfire zones are "entering a critical stage."

Wildfires already were pinching the availability of coverage in large sections
of the state, new data show. The number of homeowners in fire-prone areas who
complained about getting dropped by their plans increased 250 percent from 2010
to 2016, Jones's department reported Thursday. In the 24 counties with the
greatest wildfire risk, the number of policies canceled by companies increased
15 percent from 2015 to 2016 alone; in at least six of

those counties, that number grew by more than 50 percent.

California was struck by a series of wildfires starting last fall that damaged
or destroyed more than 14,700 homes, according to the regulator. Those losses
resulted in "more than $9 billion in insured damages so far." One Southern
California fire started in December, known as the Thomas fire, burned more
acreage than any other blaze in the state's history.

Who pays the cost of the destructive fury

The pressure on California's market is a warning for states elsewhere, according
to climate and industry experts. The number of acres consumed by wildfires each
year has doubled since 2000, according to federal data. The Union of Concerned
Scientists warns that warmer and drier conditions caused by climate change will
mean even more fires. Meanwhile, the number of people who live in the most
fire-prone areas keeps growing.

"We used to have in this country a wildfire season, and now we have wildfire
risk in multiple states all year long," said Julie Rochman, president of the
Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety, an industry-funded research
group that looks at how to make homes more resilient to extreme weather. She
said rising premiums in California reflect the growing exposure to wildfires,
and people in other states could gradually see their rates become harder to
afford as well.

In Thursday's report, the regulator urged lawmakers for changes that would make
it harder for companies to increase rates or cancel coverage. Those proposals
include preventing carriers from dropping homeowners that take specific steps to
reduce their wildfire exposure, requiring insurers to seek state approval for
the models they use to calculate wildfire risk and letting homeowners appeal
those risk calculations.

Providers of residential coverage say they will resist any changes that make it
harder for them to sell policies that reflect the true risk of wildfires. That
would force insurers to charge higher premiums in safer parts of the state,
according to Rex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of
California, which represents the industry.

"Of course, people who choose to live in the forest and local governments that
continue to approve development in the forest would like less fire-prone areas
to subsidize them," Frazier said by email. "But that just 'solves' one problem
by creating another."

Insurers weren't the only ones to warn about reducing the cost of coverage in
wildfire zones. Alice Hill, a senior adviser on climate resilience to President
Barack Obama, said people thinking about buying homes in wildfire areas should
instead use the cost of protection as an indication of whether it's a good idea
to buy there.

"When we see insurers pulling back from markets, it's because the risk is
increasing," Hill, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, said by phone.
"If those risks are getting too high, it's a strong signal that we need to
change our ways."

Jones said he supports changes to local planning and regulations to avoid
putting people in dangerous areas in the first place. But he called higher rates
"a very crude tool" to accomplish that.

"By the time the insurance price signal is being sent, the homes are built, the
businesses are built and people are moving in," Jones said. "If you wait and try
to rely on insurance as a way of getting better decisions made, it's too late."

Rochman, of the institute, said higher prices in California and elsewhere are
more likely to produce still more generous government assistance, subsidizing
people's desire to live where they want, despite the risk.

"We're going to continue to shovel millions and billions of dollars in disaster
recovery out the door," Rochman said. "We're not a country that likes brutal
honesty."

Slow start for B.C.Ã¢â[#x201a]¬â[#x201e]¢s 2017 wildfire season

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 260 words


British Columbia's 2017 wildfire season hasn't heated up just yet, according to
BC Wildfire Service numbers.

So far this year, about 1615 hectares have burned around the province. Last
year, enormous fires in the Prince George fire centre pushed that number of to
about 92,513 hectares burned by the end of June. The number of fires saw an
increase as well. There were 84 wildfires during the first six months of 2016
but only 25 in the same time period for 2017. In total, the province spent
$122.9 million fighting wildfires last year.

Spokeswoman Claire Allen says there were about 30 new wildfire starts over the
Canada Day weekend and 20 of them are believed to be human-caused.

"Wildfire activity increased dramatically in the Peace Region on April 18, when
over 40 fires ignited within the span of a few hours," the province said.
"Investigators found evidence to suggest at least 10 of these wildfires had been
deliberately set."

The province called the start of 2016's wildfire season "unusually early and
active," but noted that the season as a whole was not out of line with previous
years; in fact, 2015 had close to three times the amount of land burned by
wildfires compared to 2016.

B.C. currently has 13 active fires: two each in the Cariboo, Northwest and
Prince George fire centres, one in the Kamloops fire centre and three in the
Southeast fire centre.

Study Blames Humans for 85 Percent of Wildfires in the United States

BYLINE: Mariela Koleva

LENGTH: 502  words


Wildfires across the United States lead to massive destruction, loss to
environment, cost for nearby communities and expenses for emergency services. A
new study has claimed that nearly 84 percent of all the wildfires in the United
States during the last two decades have been caused due to human carelessness or
arson. Under drier and warmer conditions, the risk of wildfires has increased
and people should be extra careful to save our environment and forest cover. The
study conducted by researchers at the University of Colorado and University of
Massachusetts has checked data regarding wildfires between 1992 and 2012.

The study team said that nearly 84 percent of wildfires could be linked human
carelessness or deliberate action and rest of them were caused by lightning.
Most lighting related fires occur during the summer months. The research team
noted nearly 40,000 fires caused each year sparked by humans during fall, spring
and winter.

The study team further informed that 29 percent of fires were caused by burning
trash. 21 percent of fires could be linked to arson while 11 percent were caused
by misuse of equipment. Smokers caused nearly 3 percent of wildfires while
children were linked to four percent of the cases. Campfires led to nearly 4
percent of wildfires. Clearly, burning trash and debris is a major issue which
should be addressed by local authorities. Authorities have been working to
educate people about risk of campfire and smoking leading to wildfires but trash
burning has emerged as a major cause.

Study details have been published in Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences.

The cost of fighting wildfires touched $2 billion in year 2016 in the United
States. The study team only checked about wildfires that prompted firefighters
to respond. Majority of wildfires caused by lightning in the wild have not been
covered under the current study. The report informed, "Fires ignited by
lightning were responsible for about half of the area burned by wildfires, with
natural fires started in wilderness areas more likely to be left to burn
themselves out."

"Part of the message here does appear to be a little bit reminiscent of Smokey
the Bear," said University of Idaho climate and geography researcher John
Abatzoglou, a coauthor of the new study. "Smokey the Bear isn't totally wrong.
But not right, either."

"If a campfire grows out of control during a wet, cool period, then it probably
isn't going to grow into a large wildfire," University of Utah fire scientist
Philip Dennison, who wasn't part of the study, told the Associated Press.
"Climate change loads the dice toward warmer, drier conditions that make it more
likely that a fire will develop from human-caused ignitions."

"Arson fires are ignited for a variety of reasons," said Jeffrey P. Prestemon, a
U.S. Forest Service researcher who wasn't involved with the study. "One of them
is revenge - an arsonist may be trying to get back at a landowner for some
reason. And another reason might be pure vandalism."

Fire prevention key amid climate-change dangers: internal gov't document

BYLINE: Bethany Lindsay and Larry Pynn, Vancouver Sun

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A4

LENGTH: 733 words


As the planet heats up and the risk of "mega fires" rises, B.C. will no longer
be able to lean on its world-class wildfire-fighting teams to keep people and
property safe, according to a draft provincial document.

The Forests Ministry paper, called Climate Change Adaption Action Plan for
Wildfire Management 2014-2024, suggests fire prevention should become the top
priority of the province.

"It is not an option to continue to increase fire suppression response and
associated costs, because even the most aggressive action would neither be safe
nor effective for the extreme wildfire events such as those seen in Kelowna in
2003 and Slave Lake in 2010," reads the draft, obtained through a freedom of
information request.

"During these events, suppression response cannot be relied upon to protect
communities or natural resource values. The only protection provided will be the
protection established before the fire, provided through wildlandurban interface
fuel reduction and landscape fire management."

The document, dated last April, says the average temperature in B.C. is
predicted to rise by four degrees by 2080. That warming trend, combined with the
higher rate of wildfire spread in forests affected by the mountain pine beetle,
means that "mega fires" will be increasingly common.

The Insurance Bureau of Canada has predicted that severe wildfires will happen
at least 50 per cent more often by 2050.

Besides the safety concerns, extreme wildfire fire seasons can have huge
economic impacts. The 2003 wildfire season cost B.C. $1.3 billion in
firefighting costs and indirect economic losses.

The draft suggests B.C. approach the problem by investing in "fire planning and
management at all scales."

The proposed strategies include encouraging private landowners to participate in
the FireSmart Canada program, which teaches homeowners about planting fire-safe
vegetation and shows developers how to plan projects with wildfire prevention in
mind. The plan also calls for communities in high-risk areas to develop fire
protection strategies that include removing potential fuels like dry brush in
areas where wilderness meets human habitation.

On a broader scale, the draft paper suggests bringing together local
governments, First Nations, the forest industry and natural resource managers to
create a widespread system of fuel breaks - things like roadways and other gaps
in vegetation that can prevent wildfires from spreading. It also calls for fire
prevention measures to be included in all land management planning and
communication strategies to keep the public informed about wildfire risks.

The documents released by the Forests Ministry also include a 2012 discussion
paper from the Wildfire Management Branch that warns of the alarming impacts
climate change - combined with pine-beetle die-off - could have on the size,
frequency and severity of wildfires in the southern Interior of B.C. The report
predicts that by 2080, the region will experience:

An increase in the size of major fires, doubling from an average of 7.9 square
kilometres to 19 square kilometres.

An increase in the severity of fires, by 40 per cent in spring, 95 per cent in
summer and 30 per cent in fall.

A longer fire season and a 30-per-cent jump in the number of fires.

A four to seven per cent increase in severe fire behaviour, such as crowning,
when fire jumps rapidly from the top of one tree to another.

"Along with increasing wildfire potential, the costs of suppression response and
the economic losses will also increase exponentially, including losses to
communities, natural resource values and midterm timber supply," the paper
predicts.

The province in 2004 identified 17,300 square kilometres potentially at risk of
wildfires - 6,850 square kilometres of that high risk. To date, just 430 square
kilometres have been managed to reduce fuels.

"The benefit of this initiative was clearly demonstrated in 2009 and 2010
wildfire seasons when three communities - West Kelowna, Alexis Creek and
Barnhartvale - were spared major wildfire damages as a result of successful fuel
reduction projects," the paper said.

As a result of the 2003 Kelowna wildfires and the 2004 report into those fires,
the provincial and federal governments spent $37 million on a wildfire
prevention program. The province added another $25 million in 2011 to assist
local governments and First Nations to reduce the risk to wildfires.

How will Canada manage its wildfires in the future?

SECTION: OPINION; Pg. A6

LENGTH: 998 words


It's been a record-setting year for devastating and deadly wildfires across
Canada and throughout the world. This year alone, wildfires globally have burned
about four million square kilometres of land, taken hundreds of lives and
resulted in billions of dollars in economic losses.

We can only expect wildfires to get worse. Wildfires need a combination of three
ingredients: dry fuel, ignition and weather. Climate change can influence all
three of these elements, and will increase the number of wildfires and the
intensity of their behaviour by mid-century.

But if we invest in wildfire science now, we can learn to manage them better so
we can save lives, homes, businesses - and our forests - for the future.

In Canada, the wildfire season, which typically runs from April to October,
started off slowly. That changed dramatically when close to 220 fires burned in
British Columbia over two days in early July, forcing the evacuation of numerous
communities.

It turned out to be a very long, hot, dry and smokey summer in British Columbia.
In total, over 12,000 square kilometres - roughly half the size of Vermont -
burned. That's head-andshoulders above the previous record of 8,570 square
kilometres burned in 1958, which was a record then.

The Northwest Territories, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba saw a lot of fire
activity too.

The direct fire management expenditures in Canada this year will probably exceed
$1 billion, likely one of the costliest years on record.

More than 30,000 square kilometres of land has burned in Canada in four of the
past five years, for the first time in history. The one year that did not exceed
30,000 square kilometres was 2016, the year of the Fort McMurray fire, the most
expensive natural disaster in Canadian history.

Climate change isn't the only reason we're seeing more fires and larger ones,
but it is an important factor.

Temperatures across Canada continue to warm throughout the year. During the past
69 years, the average annual temperature has risen 1.7C. Warmer temperatures
lead to drier forest fuels and to more lightning strikes - an important trigger
for wildfires.

With our changing climate, we can expect more extreme weather - high
temperatures, extended heat warnings, droughts - and an increase in fire
intensity. These warmer temperatures result in drier fuels that lead to higher
intensity wildfires that overcome fire suppression activities and threaten
Canadians.

Recent research suggests that extreme fire risk in areas like Northern Alberta
has already increased by 1.5 to six times due to climate change.

Canada's largest wildfires - those exceeding two square kilometres - represent
only three per cent of the total number of wildfires, but 97 per cent of the
area burned. In other words, we don't need a large increase in the number of
high intensity wildfires to cause problems for society, including evacuations,
loss of property and death.

The most effective time to catch and stop an unwanted fire is right after it has
started. During this brief window, fire management resources - on the ground and
in the air - can suppress the fire before it has had a chance to grow and to
burn at high intensity.

But how long that window stays open depends on the weather. If it's hot and dry,
it may be as short as 20 minutes.

In areas where the things we value are farther apart, we must step back from
aggressive fire suppression and allow the fires to burn. This makes economic and
ecological sense.

At the same time we'll also have to focus more effort in high value areas, both
before fires happen and when they occur, so that fire management resources can
respond to more imminent threats. Only by taking on more risk in some
situations, can we reduce the change of major losses in others. This is a
philosophical approach called appropriate response.

The outcomes won't always be as expected.

Both fire management agencies and the public need to realize and accept this.

We need to anticipate - and prepare for - wildfires that occur in community
zones, so that we can attack them early and effectively to reduce their impact
or even stop their spread.

This is where fire science intersects with fire management. Fire science
explores and interprets the fire environment. This includes the moisture content
of important forest fuels and the ease of igniting those fuels, as well as
wildfire characteristics such as spread rate, flame length and the depth of
burning in the forest floor. It creates predictive tools that allow fire
managers to estimate and manage risk in challenging and complex wildfire
scenarios.

With the wildfire risk and the complexity of the fire management business on the
rise, we need to be able to make better predictions about wildfire behaviour to
support wildfire planning and decision making.

Canadian wildfire managers cannot be expected to manage the risks associated
with increased fire activity with the same old tools they have been using for
decades.

For example, we can use machine learning to help predict when and where to
expect severe fire weather.

We are, however, trying to develop appropriate decision support aids despite
decades of under-funding of fire science in this country.

In particular, the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council, a federal
funding agency, has dropped the ball. None of its funding programs have
identified wildfire as a priority research topic.

However, there is no realistic amount of funding that can fire proof our
wildland landscapes and communities. Where there are fuels, ignition sources and
hot, dry and windy weather, there will be fires.

Still we must strive to make those things we value more fire-resistant. The
urgency is upon us to begin to act, as the consequences of inaction will only
grow larger as time passes.

Wildfire fighters get high-tech tool

BYLINE: Carl Laundrie Staff Writer

SECTION: C; Pg. 1C

LENGTH: 668  words

DATELINE: BUNNELL


Most forest firefighters are more comfortable at the controls of a bulldozer
than at a computer. But while a computer mouse won't move dirt or put out fires,
it may become a more effective firefighting tool for Volusia and Flagler
counties within two months.

After 20 years on the job, Mike Kuypers, a state Division of Forestry district
supervisor, has a pretty good knowledge of wildfires and the damage they can do.

Kuypers, whose district includes Volusia and Flagler counties, was here in 1985
when wildfires destroyed 130 homes in Flagler County, and in 1998 when about 370
homes were destroyed or damaged statewide by wildfires. He knows the trouble
spots -- the vegetation, local weather patterns and a wildfire's likely path.

A new computer software package could put such infor mation at the fingertips of
dispatchers, land planners, firefighters or anyone else in state and local
government concerned about wildfires.

The new Fire Risk Assessment System takes high-resolution satellite imagery of
the entire state, plugs in everything state foresters know about vegetation,
wildfire fuels, weather and population figures and brings it to one screen.

After the state's 1998 wildfires, one recommendation out of a committee
appointed by then-Gov. Lawton Chiles focused on developing something to give
managers a strategic view of the state's wildfire risk to help prevent loss of
life and property to wildfires.

The Division of Forestry contracted with Space Imaging Solutions of Salt Lake
City. Teams of foresters were sent to 3,000 plots throughout the state to assess
conditions.

"What we feel we have is a fuels map that is 90 percent accurate," Kuypers said.

The computer map breaks the state into quarter-acre pixels that are shaded to
depict vegetation types and conditions in each area. Included is weather history
for 18 regions based on the forestry district maps, soil types, roads and
buildings.

When a wildfire is reported, dispatchers log the location into the system and
retrieve risk information.

The computer program also is handy for planning, Kuypers said.

"You can play 'what-if' games with it," Kuypers said. "You can go in and ask: If
I control-burn this area, what will the risk of wildfire be in a year? In two
years?"

Controlled burns are ignited and controlled by forestry personnel under ideal
conditions. The goal is to burn off underbrush and dead vegetation to decrease
wildfire danger.

The program also will help identify high-risk areas that need to be burned.

"There is always 10 times more burning that needs to be done than gets done in a
year," Kuypers said.

The battle facing forestry officials trying to keep wildfire danger at safe
levels can be summed up as manpower and machines versus the land. There are 20
rangers and 10 tractors to conduct yearly controlled burns and fight wildfires
on 530,000 acres of wild lands in Volusia County and 270,000 acres in Flagler
County.

"In a situation like 1998, we bring in others to help out," Kuypers said. "Just
like a city fire department, we can't staff for the worst-case scenario."

The computer system now is available to forestry district offices throughout the
state. However, its supervisors, including Kuypers, are just learning how to use
it.

"We are looking at an interim training period and we will launch the system in
about 60 days," said Jim Karels with the Division of Forestry in Tallahassee.

Karels said the system was funded by a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant
of about $600,000. The grant paid for the computer system and the work forestry
put into gathering information for the database.

The computer program already has pointed out some problems for Volusia and
Flagler counties.

"It shows the areas burned in 1998 are coming back," Kuypers said. "Some are in
the high-hazard range again."

Would this new computer program have made a difference in 1998?

"It wouldn't have stopped the fires," Kuypers said, "but if we had it previous
to 1998, it might have helped as a planning tool."

Alberta wildfire season begins

BYLINE: Taryn Brandell, Mayerthorpe Freelancer

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A6

LENGTH: 459  words


Alberta's wildfire season began on March 1 with a number of important measures
being put in place to ensure the province is prepared.

The Whitecourt Forest Area has been active through the winter months, working
with communities and industries in wildfire preparedness and continuing to
increase staff numbers with the town's seasonal firefighters.

Shannon Stambaugh, an information officer for Alberta Wildfire, explained the
impact of current weather conditions on potential forest fires in the province.

"The current snow is preventing wildfires from starting and spreading in our
forested areas but the snow pack itself does not have much impact on the
wildfire danger once it melts, since most of it is lost to spring runoff," she
said. "As snow starts to melt, dead, dry grasses will be exposed. These
conditions allow for wildfires to catch easily and move quickly."

However this does not reduce the risk of a "holdover" fire from occuring.
Stambaugh explains this type of wildfire, "starts from an improperly
extinguished fall or winter burn site."

The public has a responsibility to help prevent fires from occuring and there
are a number of ways to do so Stambaugh added. The first being that, it is
currently advised people return and check fall or winter burn sites. "Stir the
debris, check for any hot spots" and ensure the site is completely extinguished.
Second is obtaining a fire permit. Permits are free and can be requested from
any office of Alberta Agriculture and Forestry.

Off-highway vehicles are another hazard that need to be monitored. Branches, mud
and grass have the potential to build up on the vehicle which can then ignite,
fall from the machine and start a wildfire. It is important to keep the machine
debris free.

There is an app that can be used to find information on wildfires in the area.
The app, Alberta Wildfire, is free for any Android or Apple user.

According to the government of Alberta, last year approx. 1,231 fires were in
the area burning more than 49,000 hectares in the province, with around 64 per
cent of those being caused by human activity.

More than 68 written warnings and tickets were issued in 2017, mainly for
burning without a permit and leaving campfires unattended. This season, fire
permits are required for all burning, with the exception of campfires, in the
Forest Protection Areas within the province.

"Wildfire prevention is a responsibility we all share and it is important to
understand safe fire practices so that everyone can enjoy Alberta's forests.
Everyone's involvement ensures that wildfire does not needlessly threaten our
homes or environment," said Stambaugh.

Any information on fire bans and restrictions are listed on Albertafirebans.ca.
Currently, there are no bans or restrictions.

The era of megafires

BYLINE: Trevor Crawley

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 1063 words


Forestry management policies in the western United States have contributed to a
new era of mega-wildfires, says an expert who delivered a public presentation
alongside local emergency personnel at the College of the Rockies on Monday.

Dr. Paul Hessburg, a research landscape ecologist with the US Forest Service who
has spent the last 30 years studying forestry and fire behaviour, focused his
presentation on factors that have contributed to the rise of large wildfires
over the last 80 years.

It was an apropos conversation given the wildfire situation in the BC Interior,
as 218 fires are currently burning across the province covering over 40,000
hectares.

Dr. Hessburg opened the discussion with a personal anecdote of how his home
community of Wenatchee, WA, experienced a wildfire threatening the community in
2015.

He reflected back on the incident as he shifted the presentation to the history
of the US Forest Service and the dual relationship between the removal of large,
fire-resistant trees on open rangeland landscapes and the increasing
effectiveness of wildfire suppression.

Denser forest landscapes that were traditionally renewed and regenerated through
natural grassland wildfire, combined with a focus on extinguishing wildfires as
quickly as possible, has given rise to forest landscapes that can spread quickly
and burn hot.

"It's pretty important to understand that fire has a role in the natural
landscape, and it's a pretty big one," said Dr. Hessburg. "Everything that lives
in the woods and on the range actually depends on building a life history with
wildfire. For thousands of years, most of the native plants and animals that
we're aware of, have actually adapted to fire - some even require it in order to
survive and complete their life cycle."

Dr. Hessburg cited Ponderosa Pine, which has a thick bark that is fire resistant
and can protect the tree, while burned forest grasslands allow seeds to
germinate. Bird species use burned trees to knock out cavities for nests, while
ungulates such as deer or elk feed on plant life that thrive after a fire event.

Dr. Hessburg showed photographs of the same landscapes taken in 1930 and in 2010
that showed just how creeping forest growth had replaced what was once an mostly
open grassland range.

"These grassy areas were capable, often, of supporting forests that a grass fire
cycle kept them in grassland, so you had this very patchy grass with forest,"
Dr. Hessburg said. "Elsewhere in the forest, fires were frequently thinning the
forest, maintaining open canopy conditions and this actually reinforced the
likelihood that the next fire that came along wouldn't be severe - it'd be a
thinning fire."

Logging also played a part, as large, old trees were removed and replaced by a
younger, denser forest that wasn't fire-resistant and couldn't sustain that
grassland wildfire lifecycle.

"The logging was removing the larger fire-tolerant trees, survivors of centuries
of fires," Dr. Hessburg said. "These are the big ponderosa pine, douglas fir,
the western larch, and they were being replaced by thin-bark, fire-sensitive,
shade-tolerant Grand fir, White fir, Douglas fir and Lodgepole pine. Decade
after decade, fuels after logging were simply accumulating on the forest floor."

He walked back through history, noting that forest landscapes had been managed
by Indigenous Peoples who understood the value of controlled grassland burns
before European settlers had come out to the American West in the mid-1850s.

"They were burners, and they were capable fire-managers," said Dr. Hessburg.
"They created forage areas around their encampments for deer and elk and bison
that they hunted. They didn't have to go far. And later when they had large
horse herds, they pastured horses in areas that the burned for the graze.

"...One of the most important things they figured out by living on the landscape
in a wildfire environment, they figured out that if they burn in the spring and
the fall, they can avoid most of the out-of-control summer fires. That's a big
idea and they figured it out a long time ago."

While settlers adopted the Indigenous practice of controlled burning at first,
that fell away after the U.S. government removed Indigenous populations to
reservations, Dr. Hessburg said.

Other impacts interrupting the ecological lifecycle include a massive
introduction of livestock that decimated grasslands, the traditional conveyer
belt for grassland wildfire. Railway construction and new towns springing up on
the American frontier also began to criss-cross the landscape, blocking the
natural flow of grassland wildfire.

From the 1930s, increased funding to the U.S. Forest Service led to increased
success at fire suppression, however, by the 1980s, the focus on putting out
wildfires as quickly as possible had led to a huge fuel buildup, which is a
catalyst for the huge wildfires that burn thousands of acres.

Moving from forest landscapes and factors for large wildfire events, Dr.
Hessburg shifted to the wildland urban interface (WUI) - the zone between human
developments and unoccupied forested lands. Costs to fight wildfires in the WUI
skyrocket when factoring in personnel and equipment, when prevention can mean
only spending a fraction of that incurred cost.

"For us, the time to decide on where to build, what to build with, designing in
defensible neighbourhood plans, and separate roads in and out of developments -
that's well before the wildfires," Dr. Hessburg said. "Once the wildfires are
roaring, it's typically too late."

He put out a call for action on tackling the threat of large mega-wildfires,
noting that it's up to the public to get educated on the matter and press for
changes. Lobbying government to utilize tools such as prescribed burning,
selective mechanical thinning or even managed wildfire - controlling and
steering a wildfire to burn out appropriate areas - will be key to preventing
large wildfires. Especially without prescribed burning, mechanical thinning
becomes a huge piece of the solution, he added.

"Until we, the owners of our private lands and also our public forests lands,
claim that it's our high priority and our responsibility, we're on a path to
continued losses to these large and destructive megafires," said Dr. Hessburg.
"As individuals, we have a responsibility to make our homes, our yards, our
communities fire-resilient. It's up to us."

Officials brace for wildfire season;
Area currently at high risk as ground being dried out by sun, wind and low
humidity.

SECTION: A; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 577 words


Officials with the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources are
gearing up for a wildfire season that could erupt any day.

Wind, sun and low humidity are rapidly drying out the ground and raising the
potential for wildfires in the area, according to DCNR Assistant District
Forester Nick Lylo. Similar conditions resulted in 78 wildfires last spring in
Lylo's district, which includes Luzerne, Lackawanna, Wyoming, Wayne and
Susquehanna counties. Only five of the 83 wildfires last year didn't occur in
the spring.

The spring fires burned 557 acres and kept DCNR's 31 fire suppression employees
busy.

"The majority of wildfires are in the spring, and the fire season starts now and
continues to Memorial Day, when the forest vegetation turns green," Lylo said.

The bare tree branches contribute to the size of a wildfire because, without a
leaf canopy, sunlight and wind can penetrate the forest floor and quickly dry
what Lylo calls "fine fuels," such as twigs, leaves and grasses.

"Any wildfire is something we don't want," he said. "In our area, they all are
dangerous and potentially harmful to people and property."

The danger factor is increased in areas where the suburban landscape mixes with
rural, forested regions. Places such as Bear Creek and Dennison townships are
prime examples of areas where homes are intertwined in the forest landscape,
Lylo said. Those are the areas where the fire threat is the greatest.

"When you get these windy, dry conditions during this time of year, it doesn't
take much for a fire to really blow up on you," he said.

According to the National Interagency Fire Center, a federal agency charged with
monitoring wildfires around the country, northeastern Pennsylvania is currently
under a high risk for wildfires. The National Weather Service in Binghamton,
N.Y., has issued a Red Flag Warning for Luzerne County through today. A Red Flag
Warning means the weather conditions that lead to wildfires exist and any
outdoor burning should be avoided. Those conditions, according to NWS
meteorologist Ted Champney, include strong winds greater than 15 miles per hour,
low relative humidity and low moisture in ground debris.

Champney said the humidity level will stay low, approximately 20 percent today,
and wind gusts will continue to exceed 15 miles per hour.

"The conditions will change and there could be a bit more moisture in the air on
Saturday, but it could be another Red Flag Day until we rain late Sunday," he
said. "The risk for fires is definitely higher right now when the woods aren't
green."

Lylo said crews from DCNR's three fire divisions in Hazleton, Hughestown and
Scranton will continue patrolling traditional wildfire areas while the dry
conditions persist. If a fire does occur, the DCNR crews act as the lead
responding agency.

Lylo said his district already experienced two wildfires this spring   two on
Wednesday near Suscon Road.

"The most common causes of wildfires are people cleaning up their yards and
burning the debris, or arson," Lylo said. "The arson problem is pretty heavy in
this area."

To report a potential wildfire, call 911. DCNR Assistant Forester Nick Lylo said
the agency's fire suppression crews are linked into the 911 service and will
respond immediately. In addition to routine patrols, DCNR maintains fire towers
in high-risk wildfire areas. Locally, fire towers are located in Bear Creek
Township, Buck Township, Butler Township, Ricketts Glen State Park and near
Mehoopany.

Warming up to Wildfire Electronic service injects humanity into phone mail

BYLINE: Bruce Haring

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 8D

LENGTH: 586 words


Hate phone mail?

Say hello to Wildfire. She'll return the greeting warmly.

"I think about it as 'she,' " says Rick Smolan of Sausalito,
Calif., the photographer who organized last year's 24 Hours in
Cyberspace project. He has been a Wildfire user for two years.
"It's sort of like a friend and companion."


Actually, Wildfire is a leading-edge message service intended
to change people's minds about phone mail. The Wildfire Electronic
Assistant responds to more than 100 voice commands in the style
of a warm, friendly secretary. For example:

-- Wildfire recognizes frequent callers with a cheerful, "Oh,
hi!"

-- It places calls after simple spoken commands. "Call Frank,"
for example, will automatically trace the person through up to
five numbers. Up to 150 names can be stored this way. And conference
calls can also be quickly set up with simple voice commands.

-- It screens messages by asking for a caller's name, then whispering
it to its owner (if he or she is on a phone somewhere) before
connecting or taking a message.

-- And Wildfire evaluates phone usage patterns, politely offering
additional services tailored to individual work styles.

Wildfire also has a sense of humor. Tell it you're depressed and
it replies, "You're depressed? I live in a box." Call after
midnight and the system sleepily answers before kicking into work
mode.

Although users find it simple, Wildfire uses such sophisticated
technology as speech recognition, digital transmission and intelligent
agents.

Creator Bill Warner, who invented the groundbreaking Avid film
editing system that became Hollywood's standard in the late 1980s,
says he always was fascinated by the issue of how people connect.

When he began work on Wildfire in the early '90s, he envisioned
it eliminating pink phone message slips and easing communication.

But Warner says he "always focused on it being a machine." It
was design engineer Tony Lovell who told him, "You've got it
wrong," Warner recalls. Lovell told him, "It's got to be a person.
People understand how to talk to people."

Warner was convinced at the system's first test. He picked up
the phone and queried, "Wildfire?" It replied in Lovell's voice,
"Here I am!"

"From there on, it was alive! Talk about Frankenstein," says
Warner, still excited five years later. "Now, when we have arguments
about it, it's 'No, that's not her personality, she wouldn't be
that way.' "

Phone companies' commercial voice technology has never advanced
far beyond touch-tone systems. "If people get stuck talking to
a machine, they'll tolerate it for a little bit," Warner says.
"People who talk with Wildfire end up saying 'goodbye.' "

Now in San Diego, Wildfire will soon spread throughout Southern
California via Pacific Bell, which offers regular and wireless
phone service. Other markets are expected soon.

Premium versions of Wildfire are available through independent
providers and The Sharper Image. The basic Wildfire system costs
$ 5-$ 10 a month; the premium Wildfire Gold runs $ 40-$ 200. Both
require no additional equipment. (A demo and information are at
800-945-3347.)

And the voice of Wildfire? Several were tried before the right
tone was found. The person chosen isn't an actress but "an everyday
hard-working person who is bright and well-schooled" is all Warner
will reveal. She doesn't want her identity known: "She does not
want to have everybody in the world calling her up."

Budget deal includes wildfire disaster fund to end borrowing

BYLINE: Matthew Daly; The Associated Press

ABSTRACT

A spending bill approved by the House includes a bipartisan plan to create a
wildfire disaster fund to help combat increasingly severe wildfires that have
devastated the West in recent years

FULL TEXT

WASHINGTON >> A spending bill approved by the House includes a bipartisan plan
to create a wildfire disaster fund to help combat increasingly severe wildfires
that have devastated the West in recent years.

The bill sets aside more than $20 billion over 10 years to allow the Forest
Service and other federal agencies end a practice of raiding non-fire-related
accounts to pay for wildfire costs, which approached $3 billion last year.

The House approved the measure Thursday, with Senate action expected soon after
as Congress faces a Friday night deadline to avoid a partial government
shutdown.

Western lawmakers have long complained that the current funding mechanism - tied
to a 10-year average for wildfires - makes budgeting difficult, even as fires
burn longer and hotter each year.

The new plan sets aside $2 billion per year - outside the regular budget - so
officials don't have to tap money meant for prevention programs to fight
wildfires.

"Common sense has finally prevailed when it comes to how the Forest Service pays
to fight record-breaking forest fires that devastate homes and communities in
Oregon and the West," said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who helped broker the deal
with Sens. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. GOP Reps. Mike
Simpson of Idaho and Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington also played key roles,
along with other lawmakers from both parties.

The Western lawmakers have been fighting for years to end "fire borrowing," a
practice they say devastates rational budgeting for the Forest Service and other
agencies.

"This long-overdue, bipartisan solution to the madness of 'fire borrowing' will
at last treat these infernos like the natural disasters they are, with the
benefit that millions of dollars will now be liberated each year for essential
wildfire prevention," Wyden said in a statement.

The wildfire deal "puts an end to fire-borrowing and is a start to giving the
Forest Service the predictable resources they need to reduce hazardous fuels"
such as small trees and underbrush that exacerbate wildfires, Cantwell said.

"This funding boost will allow the Forest Service to prioritize work in areas
closest to communities, in order to save lives and reduce the risk of property
damage, while still protecting essential public lands and existing environmental
laws," said Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee.

The measure establishes a contingency account through 2027, with annual deposits
starting at $2.1 billion and increasing to $2.9 billion. Money from the account
would only be used after funds from usual firefighting accounts are exhausted.

Wildfires have burned across dried-out Western forests and grassland in recent
years, causing billions of dollars in damage in California, Oregon and other
states. The Forest Service and Interior Department spent more than $2.7 billion
last year fighting fires - the most expensive wildfire season on record.

The budget deal includes $100 million for fire prevention projects and
recreation programs and enables utilities to work with the Forest Service to
prevent trees from touching power lines and starting wildfires.





Simpson, a senior member of the House appropriations panel, called the wildfire
fund one of his most significant accomplishments in nearly two decades in
Congress.

"It is long past due that wildfires in the West receive equal treatment with
other natural disasters, and this bill delivers the necessary budget changes to
stop the dangerous practice of fire borrowing that has led to catastrophic
wildfires in Idaho and throughout the West," he said.

Sun sets on Ransom"s Wildfire

SECTION: TECHNOLOGY; General

LENGTH: 327 words


Wildfire, the social media marketing company co-founded by Kiwi expat Victoria
Ransom and bought by Google for US$250 million is being "sunsetted" barely 18
months after the acquisition.

"The Wildfire Social Marketing Suite... will continue to be supported, but
further investments will be limited: we won"t be building new features or
signing up new customers," Ransom said in a blog.

Wildfire helps companies promote themselves through social media platforms such
as Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest.

Ransom said last year Google began integrating Wildfire"s technology into
DoubleClick - Google"s unified platform built to help advertisers and agencies
manage their digital marketing efforts.

"To help accelerate this, we"ve decided to dedicate our resources to this
integration," Ransom said.

Blogger Andrew Jones said Google"s purchase of Wildfire in 2012 took many by
surprise but the sunsetting of the social marketing suite was not a shock.

"What did Google want with a Social Relationship Management company? Google is
in the ad business," Jones wrote.

He says the shuttering of Wildfire is an important event because it signals a
consolidation of the Social Relationship Management industry and because it
emphasizes the value of social data.

"This (Wildfire- DoubleClick) integration provides marketers better social
attribution...giving marketers broader insight into overall ad performance and
the customer journey," Jones said.

According to Kevin Bobowski of social media marketing software provider
Offerpop, Google purchased Wildfire originally to keep an eye on Facebook and
related social insights.

"Wildfire was born in an era when Facebook was essentially the only social
network," he told online media website the SocialTimes.

"That stream is so crowded and the organic reach is being diminished more and
more every single day."

He said Google"s acquisition may have impeded Wildfire"s innovative potential.

California firefighters say they finally 'turned a corner'

BYLINE:  By SUDHIN THANAWALA and BRIAN MELLEY Associated Press

LENGTH: 701 words


SANTA ROSA, Calif. - With the wind dying down, fire officials said Sunday that
they had apparently "turned a corner" against the wildfires that have devastated
California wine country and other parts of the state over the past week, and
thousands of people got the all-clear to return home.

Though the danger from the deadliest, most destructive cluster of blazes in
California history was far from over, the smoky skies started to clear in some
places.

"A week ago this started as a nightmare, and the day we dreamed of has arrived,"
Napa County Supervisor Belia Ramos said.

People were being allowed to go home in areas no longer in harm's way, and the
number of those under evacuation orders was down to 75,000 from nearly 100,000
the day before.

Fire crews were able to gain ground because the wind that had fanned the flames
did not kick up overnight as much as feared.

"Conditions have drastically changed from just 24 hours ago, and that is
definitely a very good sign," said Daniel Berlant, spokesman for California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, who noted that some of the fires
were 50 percent or more contained. "It's probably a sign we've turned a corner
on these fires."

The blazes were blamed for at least 40 deaths and destroyed some 5,700 homes and
other structures. The death toll could climb as searchers dig through the ruins
for people listed as missing. Hundreds were unaccounted for, though authorities
said many of them were probably safe but hadn't let anyone know.

In hard-hit Sonoma County, Sheriff Rob Giordano said authorities had located
1,560 of the more than 1,700 once listed as missing. Many of those names were
put on the list after people called from out of state to say they couldn't reach
a friend or relative.

Sonoma County officials said they would not let people return home until it was
safe and utilities were restored. Crews have been working around the clock to
connect water and power, in some cases putting up new poles next to smoldering
trees, the sheriff said.

Many evacuees grew increasingly impatient to go home - or at least find out
whether their homes were spared. Others were reluctant to go back or to look for
another place to live.

Juan Hernandez, who escaped with his family from his apartment Oct. 9 before it
burned down, still had his car packed and ready to go in case the fires flared
up again and threatened his sister's house, where they have been staying in
Santa Rosa.

"Every day we keep hearing sirens at night, alarms," Hernandez said. "We're
scared. When you see the fire close to your house, you're scared."

Evacuation orders were lifted for the city of Calistoga, the Napa Valley city of
5,000 known for its mud baths, mineral spas and wine tastings. The city was
cleared out Wednesday as wind shifted, but homes and businesses were spared.

At the Sonoma fairgrounds, evacuees watched the San Francisco 49ers play the
Redskins on television, received treatment from a chiropractor and got free
haircuts.

Michael Estrada, who owns a barber shop in neighboring Marin County but grew up
in one of the Santa Rosa neighborhoods hit hard by the blazes, brought his
combs, clippers and scissors and displayed his barbering license in case anyone
doubted his credentials.

"I'm not saving lives," he said. "I'm just here to make somebody's day feel
better, make them feel normal."

Lois Krier, 86, said it was hard to sleep on a cot in the shelter with people
snoring and dogs barking through the night.

She and her husband, William Krier, 89, were anxious to get home, but after
being evacuated for a second time in a week Saturday, they didn't want to risk
having to leave again.

"We're cautious," she said. "We want to be safe."

Nearly 11,000 firefighters were still battling 15 fires burning across a
100-mile swath of the state.

In the wooded mountains east of Santa Rosa, where a mandatory evacuation
remained in place, a large plume of white smoke rose high in the sky as
firefighters tried to prevent the fire from burning into a retirement community
and advancing onto the floor of Sonoma Valley, known for its wineries.

Houses that had benefited from repeated helicopter water drops were still
standing as smoke blew across surrounding ridges.

Wildfire season officially begins Mar. 1

LENGTH: 576  words


According to a recent media release from the Alberta Agriculture and Forestry
department, preparations have been underway for the official start of wildfire
season, which is Mar. 1.

Agriculture and Forestry Minister Oneil Carlier noted in the media release as of
Mar. 1, fines and penalties will increase for burning activities. Mar. 1,
according to the media release, is also a reminder to Albertans to be extra
careful to help prevent wildfires in forested areas. The media release stated
more than 60 per cent of the wildfires last year were caused by human activity.

"Protecting Albertans from the threat of wildfire is one of our highest
priorities. That's why we legislated Mar. 1, as the start of fire season,
recognizing recent trends show wildfires are starting earlier in the spring. The
wildfire that burned into Fort McMurray last year serves as a reminder of how
important it is for us to be ready to respond to wildfires at a moment's
notice," stated Carlier in the media release.

Last year, according to the media release, 1,338 wildfires burned more than
611,000 hectares, including the Horse River wildfire that spread into Fort
McMurray. The new Forest and Prairie Protection Act, the media release pointed
out, increases penalties for abandoning campfires or burning during fire bans
and improves the government's ability to restrict higher-risk activities, such
as fireworks and incendiary targets during hazardous fire conditions.

Darryl Beaton, Lethbridge County's emergency services co-ordinator said with the
official start of the provincial fire season Mar. 1, Albertans are reminded of
how fast fire hazard conditions in the county can change from low to extreme.

"We are also reminded of the damage wildfire can cause when looking back at Fort
McMurray, Slave Lake and our own grass fire events of 2011 and 2012," Beaton
said.

Beaton added in the interest of public safety, the county would like to remind
everyone to follow regulations in the Fire Permit Bylaw and the Fire Ban Bylaw.

"Please adhere to the conditions on your fire permit and pay close attention to
the weather and the conditions of the fuels around you," said Beaton.

Fire Ban information is current and is posted on the home page of the Lethbridge
County website at lethcounty.ca and on the Alberta Fire Ban website at
albertafirebans.ca.

The Fire Ban Bylaw #1423 and the Fire Permit Bylaw #1424 can be found on the
county's website at lethcounty.ca/government/bylaws. Fire Permits are also
available, free of charge, from the home page on the county's website.

"If you have any questions regarding the regulations or what you can do to help
prevent the spread of wildfire, please contact the county Emergency Services
Department at mail@lethcounty.ca or call 403-328-5525," Beaton said. Tips to
prevent a wildfire: * Make sure your campfire is out - soak it, stir it, and
soak it again * Keep an eye on any winter burning Report a wildfire. Call
310-FIRE (3473) if you spot a wildfire. These calls ensure fire crews can
respond as quickly as possible.

According to the recent media release, with the start of fire season, fire
permits will be required for any burning, outside of campfires, in the Forest
Protection Area of Alberta. This will allow firefighters to address any winter
burning before the spring.

Fire permits are free and can be obtained by contacting your local Alberta
Agriculture and Forestry office. Phone toll-free 310-0000 to locate your nearest
office.

Severe Drought Conditions Lead to Early Start of Summer Wildfire Season across
Western U.S.

LENGTH: 543  words


May 27 -- Fireman's Fund's Risk Services Team encourages homeowners to take
action to prepare and protect their property due to hot temperatures and severe
drought conditions throughout much of the Western U.S. reported by the National
Interagency Fire Center.



Earlier this month California Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. issued a proclamation
urging Californians to get prepared for wildfires, declaring May 4-10, 2014 as '
Wildfire Awareness Week' in the state. Brown's proclamation stated that the
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) has already
responded to a 120 percent increase in wildfires this year caused by drought
conditions. He told ABC's "This Week" that the state has 5,000 firefighters and
has appropriated $600 million to battling blazes, but that may not be enough in
the future.

Fireman's Fund is in alignment with the fire service philosophy of prevention
and mitigation as the best approach in lowering risks from wildfires. Risk
services consultants, who live and work in the wildland urban interface where
wildfires typically strike, are trained to recognize wildfire risks and offer
solutions to make a home and family better prepared. They perform on-site
wildfire risk assessments of policyholders' homes and educate, bring insight and
offer advice to take preventative action.

With this annual threat of wildfire season posing serious dangers to lives and
property, it is important to think now about fire prevention and safety," said
Kathleen Stalter, risk services wildfire specialist, Fireman's Fund. "There are
several important measures people can take to make sure their homes and families
are protected."

Stalter provides these tips to protect homes from wildfire dangers like flying
embers - known to be as destructive to homes as the flames. Embers can attack a
home far from the actual spot of the wildfire.

* Family Safety: designate one emergency meeting place outside the home, and one
outside your neighborhood, where family can safely meet in an emergency.

* Create defensible space around your home and property using fire resistant
landscaping materials.

* Remove debris that accumulates in gutters and at roof-to-wall intersections
such as dormers and chimneys.

* Use fire-resistant building materials for your home and near-by structures.

* Install ember/flame resistant vents and close all windows and doors in the
event of a wildfire. Windblown embers can enter a home through vents and ignite
the home from within. All vent openings should be protected by 1/8 inch metal
mesh or baffle style covers to prevent ember intrusion.

* Roof: The roof is a landing strip for windblown embers. Remove any overhanging
tree and vine branches. Clean all leaves and other vegetative debris from your
roof and rain gutters.

* Windows: dual-paned windows with an exterior pane of tempered glass reduce the
chance of breakage in a fire.

* Decks/Balconies: enclose the underside with fire-resistant materials to
prevent embers from blowing underneath. Keep deck clear of combustible items.

* Yard: stack woodpiles at least 30 feet away from all structures, and clear
away combustible vegetation within 10 feet of woodpiles. Remove all stacks of
construction materials, pine needles, leaves and other debris from yard.

One year after wildfire, officials urge vigilance

BYLINE: Juan Castillo jcastillo@statesman.com American-Statesman Staff

LENGTH: 753 words


The strong, swirling winds that whipped across Central Texas on Sunday stirred a
sense of foreboding for Gary Hunt of Oak Hill.

They eerily reminded him of the winds that raked the wooded rolling hills and
valleys in his Scenic Brook neighborhood a year ago, fanning a wildfire that
torched 11 of his neighbors' homes and damaged 10 more.

When the winds kick up, "I get real nervous, and I get a little watchful," Hunt
said.

The Oak Hill fire ushered in a voracious wildfire season. September's Bastrop
wildfires alone were the most damaging in Texas history in terms of property
loss, and there were destructive wildfires in Pflugerville, Steiner Ranch,
Spicewood and Leander.

On Monday, as fire officials sought to highlight steps the public can take to
lessen the risks of becoming wildfire victims - clear brush, mow grass, have an
evacuation plan - they said wildfires will strike again.

"Will it happen this year? We don't know," said Lake Travis Fire and Rescue
Chief Jim Linardos. "Will it happen next year? We don't know. All we know is, we
have to be ready."

Linardos joined local and state fire officials and city and county elected
leaders Monday at the Austin Community College Pinnacle campus, near the broad,
charred scar from last year's fire, as they launched a "Wildfire Ready Austin"
campaign. They urged regional collaboration to achieve "fire-adapted"
communities where residents understand the risks of wildfires and work
proactively to mitigate damage and ensure safety in their neighborhoods.

"Wildfires don't know city limits," Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell said. "What is
certain is the devastation that can be left behind after one of those."

Leffingwell said he convened a regional summit of fire and elected officials in
February to discuss a collaborative approach to wildfire preparedness and
response. The Wild Land Task Force, a partnership between the City of Austin,
Travis County and other stakeholders, is leading a wildfire awareness campaign
that has produced a "Ready, Set, Go" brochure with tips about how home­owners
can protect themselves and their property.

The free brochure is available at Austin fire stations and online. About 9 in 10
wildfires in Texas are caused by people, according to the website, by seemingly
innocuous things like outdoor grilling and building campfires.

Monday's news conference was held on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the
Oak Hill fire , and it coincided with the beginning of wildfire season in Texas,
with its weather patterns that heighten wildfire risk.

Texas and wildfires are inextricably linked, said Justice Jones with the Texas
Forest Service, with more than 14,500 communities across the state at risk -
urban areas bordered by open land.

"There's not enough firefighters across the nation to protect all those
communities," Jones said, adding that residents and neighborhoods can do much to
help themselves and reduce their risks .

Despite recent rains, much of Central Texas remains in a significant drought,
said Harry Evans, an Austin Fire Department chief of staff. "What the rains are
doing is buying us time," Evans said. "That's important because there's a lot of
work to do."

Evans said he has seen no evidence that the rains have lulled residents into a
sense of complacency.

"It's very fresh on their minds that we had epic wildfires and with an epic
drought," Evans said. "What we see is the continued questions about 'What can I
do? How can I affect my circumstance?'"

Rosie Beck, Gary Hunt's wife and a leader in efforts to help Scenic Brook fire
victims rebuild, said heightened wildfire awareness is yielding tangible
results, such as more neighbors clearing brush around their homes and trimming
trees. She and Hunt have done the same at their house on Scenic Brook Lane,
though it was not damaged in last year's fickle wind-whipped fire, which
destroyed some homes but didn't leave a mark on others.

"The other thing is emphasizing not only preparing for the eventuality of a
fire, but also being ready for the event itself," Beck said. That means taking
care of family, children and pets and being able to grab valuable items and
medications, and then "getting out, if you have that time," Beck said.

Since last years's fire, Hunt said, the couple have stored important documents
in a fire lock box and scanned copies of them and family pictures .

"Those are the things you can't replace," Hunt said.

Public comment sought for Wildfire Protection Plan

BYLINE: Times-Standard

The Times-Standard

The comment period has been extended for the Humboldt County Community Wildfire
Protection Plan, and federal and local agencies are encouraging the public to
review and comment on the recently released Public Review Draft of the plan
update. The window for public review has been extended to Feb. 15, pursuant to a
vote last week by the Humboldt County Fire Safe Council.

The draft plan is available atwww.co.humboldt.ca.us/natural-resources
/fire_safe_council. Printed copies of the draft plan are also available at
Humboldt County Library branches in Eureka, Garberville and Willow Creek.

The purpose of the public review is for residents and stakeholders to use their
local knowledge to fact-check and evaluate the plan for technical errors or
omissions. The plan is relevant to all Humboldt County residents, especially
those living in high wildfire hazard areas. In recent years, the severity of
wildfires across the country has increased dramatically, drawing attention to
the need for community preparedness measures.

The previous version of the plan has been successfully used by community groups
throughout Humboldt County to secure substantial grant awards to support
wildfire mitigation projects. Such projects include the management of flammable
vegetation to protect community values, roadside vegetation clearance,
fire-safety education and other preventative efforts that enhance communities'
wildfire preparedness and resilience.

The council hopes the updated plan will continue to inspire action and give
local communities a competitive advantage for wildfire mitigation funding in
upcoming years.

Community Wildfire Protection Plans are a vehicle for communities to identify
priority actions to mitigate damage from wildfires and overall fire safety on
both private and public lands. They make recommendations to address identified
community needs with regard to prevention, preparedness, mitigation and wildfire
response.

The Humboldt County plan process involves extensive collaboration between
organized groups of residents, as well as local, state and federal agencies. The
plan can also be used as a resource and guide for individual communities
interested in gaining national recognition as a "Firewise" community, forming a
local fire safe council or developing their own local plan -- all activities
that can give communities considerable leverage in their eligibility for grant
funding.

This program is sponsored by the county of Humboldt, guided by the Fire Safe
Council and supported by funding from the U.S. Forest Service.

It is not a matter of if wildfires will occur in Humboldt County, but when.
However, a wildfire does not have to be a disaster. It is possible to prepare
for wildfire in such a way as to minimize impacts on life, property and the
community as a whole. The updated plan provides information about what can be
done and how to do it. Local residents can improve their odds of surviving a
wildfire by getting to know this plan.

Starting next month, the council and county staff will review and consider
feedback from the public and revise the draft plan. In April, the final draft of
the plan will be presented to the Humboldt County Board of Supervisors, the
Humboldt County Fire Chiefs' Association and Calfire for their approval.

Send comments to Cybelle Immitt in the Natural Resources Planning Division of
Humboldt County Public Works, atcimmitt@co.humboldt.ca.us , or call 268-3736.

Florida: Commissioner Putnam and Florida Forest Service Alert Floridians to
Heightened Wildfire Danger

LENGTH: 413  words



 Tallahassee:  Department of Agricuture And Consumer Service, The State of
Florida has issued the following news release:



  Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam H. Putnam and the Florida Forest
Service urge the public to exercise caution with all outdoor fires due to
increased wildfire danger levels throughout the state. Thunderstorms and
excessive lightning have sparked wildfires in many coastal areas of the state
recently, including the 1,000-acre Tide Swamp Fire in Taylor County that began
Sunday, May 29.





 "Florida's wildland firefighters will likely battle additional wildfires in the
coming weeks due to dry conditions and increased lightning activity," said
Commissioner of Agriculture Adam H. Putnam. "Citizens can do their part by
keeping preventable human-caused wildfires at bay and preparing their families
and homes for wildfire."



 Lightning accounts for approximately 25 percent of Florida's annual wildfire
activity. Because wildfire danger will rise with increased thunderstorm
activity, the Florida Forest Service is urging residents to use caution when
using fire outdoors and to remember the following:



     Develop and implement a family wildfire action plan [ Adobe PDF Document
3.40 MB ].

     Call 911 or a local Florida Forest Service field unit office immediately in
the event of a wildfire.

     Obey Florida's outdoor burning laws.

     Never burn on windy days.

     Never leave an outdoor fire or hot grill unattended.

     Keep a shovel and water hose handy in case the fire breaks containment.



 "When citizens are careful with fire, they are doing more than just protecting
themselves and their property," said Jim Karels, Florida State Forester. "They
are helping to protect the lives of Florida's wildland firefighters and first
responders."



 There are approximately 57 active wildfires currently burning throughout
Florida. Since January, the Florida Forest Service and its partners have
responded to 1,200 wildfires that have burned 18,000 acres.



 The Florida Forest Service, a division of the Florida Department of Agriculture
and Consumer Services, manages more than 1 million acres of state forests,
provides management assistance on more than 17 million acres of private and
community forests, while protecting homes, forestland and natural resources from
the devastating effects of wildfire on more than 26 million acres.

Florida: Commissioner Putnam Urges Floridians to Exercise Caution During
Florida's Wildfire Awareness Week

LENGTH: 397  words



 Tallahassee:  Department of Agricuture And Consumer Service, The State of
Florida has issued the following news release:



  Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam H. Putnam and the Florida Forest
Service are asking citizens to exercise caution with all outdoor fires during
Florida's Wildfire Awareness Week, April 10-16. Since January, nearly 800
wildfires have burned more than 13,500 acres in Florida. Most of these fires
were caused by people.





 "Wildfire Awareness Week is an important reminder of the devastating effect
wildfires can have on our communities and natural resources," said Commissioner
of Agriculture Adam H. Putnam. "Wildfire activity in Florida increases during
the spring, so it is especially important that Floridians exercise caution in
the coming months."



 Wildfire Awareness Week was created in recognition of Florida's devastating
1998 wildfire season, when more than half a million acres burned and 337
structures were damaged or destroyed by wildfires.



 The most frequent causes of wildfires during this time of year are uncontrolled
yard waste fires and unauthorized debris burns. The Florida Forest Service is
reminding citizens that authorizations are required for all burn piles larger
than 8 feet in diameter and broadcast acreage burns. Citizens should adhere to
the following outdoor fire safety requirements:



     Call before you burn to obtain an authorization;

     Make sure your burn meets Florida's required setbacks;

     Never leave a fire unattended;

     Never burn on windy days or when humidity is below 30 percent;

     Keep a water source and suppression equipment on hand; and

     Completely extinguish the fire before leaving it.



 "Fortunately, extra rainfall has helped keep many recent wildfires small and
manageable," said Florida State Forester Jim Karels. "However, conditions can
change quickly and drastically in Florida, so it is important that Floridians
understand their critical role in helping to prevent wildfires."



 The Florida Forest Service, a division of the Florida Department of Agriculture
and Consumer Services, manages more than one million acres of public forest land
while protecting homes, forestland and natural resources from the devastating
effects of wildfire on more than 26 million acres.

Sumter County develops wildfire plan

BYLINE: Americus Times-Recorder, Ga.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 363 words


Dec. 15--AMERICUS -- The local office of the Georgia Forestry Commission
announced that the agency is working with Sumter County officials to design a
Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP). CWPP's are developed by cities and
counties as part of a national initiative to protect residents in rural areas
from the threat of a disastrous wildfire.

"More and more people are choosing to live in homes just on the limits of towns
and cities in forested or wildland areas," said Brent McCarty, Chief Ranger for
the Georgia Forestry Commission. "These areas are known as the wildland/urban
interface and when wildfires occur in these regions, fire protection becomes
much more challenging. A custom CWPP enhances public safety on many fronts."

According to McCarty, the Community Wildfire Protection Plan will: improve
community sustainability, enhance safety of area residents, protect ecosystem
health, raise awareness of wildfire hazards and wildfire risk, educate
landowners about how to reduce home ignitability and build and improve
collaboration at multiple levels.

A Community Wildfire Protection Plan favorably supports Sumter County grant
applications for hazard mitigation funds through the National Fire Plan, FEMA
mitigation grants, and others. Under the Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA)
of 2003, communities (counties) that seek such grants for hazardous fuels
reduction work are required to prepare a Community Wildfire Protection Plan.

"This CWPP will provide an evaluation of Sumter County's wildland/urban
interface," explained Sumter County Fire Chief Joe Pollock. "It will be a
valuable guide and action plan to protect homes, property and lives from the
threat of wildfire."

For more information about the CWPP process or to review a copy of the Sumter
County CWPP, contact Brent McCarty at 931-2511.

Letters: Plan to control wildfire

BYLINE: The Himalayan Times

LENGTH: 475  words


This is with reference to the news story "Wildfire incidents on rise as summer
begins" (THT, March 27, Page 4). Reports from across the country say that more
forest areas are on fire this year compared to last year. As many as 424
incidents of wildfire were detected in the year 2015 by MODIS (an imaging
satellite), most of them in the Churia range. Human activities are to blame for
the wildfires that not only destroys forest areas but also the wildlife.

It has been found that about 30 percent wildfire is caused by anthropogenic
factors in Nepal and negligent amount of wildfire can be natural such as pine
forest. The wildfire severely damages and prohibit regeneration and growth of
seedlings, destroys non wood forest products, increases natural disaster and
invasive species, affects soil structure, young immobile animal species,
including nesting sites of birds with carbon emission.

A fire detection and monitoring system has been developed that sends
notification on wildfire. However this system is least known to the authorities
concerned. If this system is available even to the general public through mobile
apps or other means of communications the locals can come forward to douse the
wildfire around their locality.

Community based fire management program and forest management strategy 2010 is
being implemented by the government, and it aims at strengthening plan and
policy for wildfire prevention through integrated approach for enabling
environment for resource support to solve the problem arising from wildfire and
its impact on the environment. The policy needs to be strengthened.

Inhumane

Apropos of the news story "Amnesty International paints a bleak picture of
Nepalis in Qatar" (THT, April 1, Page 1). It is very sad news that Nepalese
workers are deprived of basic human rights in foreign lands. As Nepal government
has not been able to provide proper job opportunities to all, they are leaving
the country only to suffer a lot not imagined before. At this critical stage the
Nepal government must use its diplomatic channel to stop such inhumane treatment
to the Nepali workers in Qatar.

We have heard that even the dead bodies are also dispatched back home very late
causing much distress to the deceased family members and relatives. This is an
ugly side of the foreign employment. I, therefore, request the Nepal government
to make sincere efforts to ensure that all the working Nepali labourers are
provided with basis amenities as per the agreement and that their salaries are
paid on time. If they want to come back home they should be allowed to do so as
it is their right to quit the job if they find it very hard to continue. It is
the international community which should raise this issue constantly with the
host country which is hosting the World Cup in 2022.

PG&E Funds Local Fire Safe Council Projects, Joins CAL FIRE in Urging Residents
to Prevent, Prepare for Wildfires

LENGTH: 591  words



Pacific Gas and Electric Company has issued the following news release:

In response to one of the most severe droughts on record, Pacific Gas and
Electric Company (PG&E) announced today it is providing nearly $2 million in
funding to local Fire Safe Councils across its service area for fuel reduction
projects and public education to help prevent dangerous wildfires. PG&E is also
joining CAL FIRE during California Wildfire Awareness Week in urging residents
to prevent and prepare for wildfires. 'Wildfire Awareness Week' is observed
every year during the first week of May.

With the early-April snowpack water content standing at only five percent of
normal, most of California is at risk for devastating wildfires. That's why PG&E
is supporting CAL FIRE's public education campaigns, "One Less Spark, One Less
Wildfire"" and "Ready, Set, Go."

"At PG&E, we pride ourselves on being the public's partner in safety. We are
honored to team with firefighters on the important work they do to help educate
Californians about the dangers of wildfires and how to prevent and prepare for
them. We encourage all of our customers and employees to focus on fire safety
now and throughout the entire year," said Barry Anderson, vice president of
emergency preparedness and operations for PG&E.

"California's wildfire activity has been well above normal all year long and as
we reach the traditional summer months that trend is not likely to go away,"
said Daniel Berlant, CAL FIRE chief of public information. "That's why it is
critical that all residents are prepared for wildfires by maintaining 100 feet
of Defensible Space around their homes, and that all Californians take steps to
prevent sparking a wildfire."

In 2014, PG&E worked with 38 local Fire Safe Councils to fund fire breaks in and
around communities, improve emergency access roads and help low-income residents
clear defensible space around their properties to protect them from fire. PG&E
is proud to continue working closely with local Fire Safe Councils across
northern and central California to ensure that the communities it serves are
prepared for wildfires.

Since the beginning of this year, CAL FIRE already has responded to more than
1,000 wildfires scorching more than 4,100 acres. That's twice as many than in an
average year. Last year, CAL FIRE responded to 5,600 fires which burned 90,000
acres. According to CAL FIRE, more than 90 percent of all wildfires in
California are sparked by people. PG&E is urging its employees and customers to
use caution when operating outdoor equipment, burning debris or campfires, and
to properly maintain and tow vehicles safely. PG&E will help spread the "One
Less Spark, One Less Wildfire" message on its customer billing envelopes this
summer.

In addition to its already extensive vegetation management program, PG&E is
conducting additional aerial and ground inspections around its power lines to
help ensure that trees or limbs do not come into contact with equipment. The
utility is deploying hundreds of tree workers to mitigate fire risks across its
service area.

Wild animals, birds hit hard by wildfires in western region

BYLINE: Himalayan News Service

LENGTH: 380  words


Bajura, May 5: Wildfires, which have spread with the prolonged drought in
different community forests, have badly affected wild animals and birds in
different national and community forests of the far-west region.

A source in the regional Forest Directorate, Dhangadi, said many wild animals
along with different bird species were burnt to death in the forests due to
wildfire.

Many animals and birds have scattered and have migrated to safer areas after
their habitats were destroyed by wildfires.

It is said wild animals that managed to flee are astray.

Sources in the directorate further added that monkeys, snakes, rabbits,
porcupines, deer, wild boars and pheasants were among the wildlife killed due to
the inferno.

The sources also said a foul smell had spread from the dead creatures due to
lack of proper management.

It is said that the acute water shortage has also hit the wild animals and the
birds hard as water sources in the forest areas have also gone dry.

According to Ranger Bisal Kumar Lama of District Forest Office, Bajura, the
wildfire had spread to as many as 10 national and community forests.

District leader Dhan Raj Pandit of Nepali Congress said a few wild animals and
birds were seen in the areas of Martadi-based community forests after the
wildfire. Similarly, CPN-UML district committee member Dipak Rawat said the
incidents of wildfire surpassed that of the past years.

The directorate informed that the wildfire had spread across 72,997 hectare
forest areas in the region.

Ranger Lok Raj Dahal of the directorate said the wildfire had spread to
different national and community forests of nine districts in the far-west
region.

The wildfire had spread across 40 hectare forest area in Kailali, 175 hectare in
Bajhang, 3,342 hectare in Achham, 1,500 hectare in Baitadi, 9,570 hectare in
Kanchanpur, 290 in Bajura, 8,040 in Dadeldhura, 3,130 in Doti.

Similarly, the wildfire destroyed 6,854 hectare forest in Shuklaphanta Wildlife
Conservation Centre, 83 hectare in Apinappa Conservation area and six hectare in
Khaptad National Park.

The directorate said the wildfire was the biggest in the far-west region so far.

Ranger Lama said that Nepali Army personnel, Nepal Police, Armed Police Force
and locals have been trying hard to bring the wildfire under control.

HIGHLIGHT: WENATCHEE - From just across the Wenatchee River, Dominick Bonny
watched a whole neighborhood in his Central Washington town burn as a wildfire
destroyed two dozen homes and forced hundreds to flee."With the wind blowing
away from us, it was like we were watching a natural disaster within arm's
reach," he said.The wildfires hit parts of Central and Eastern Washington over
the weekend as the state is struggling with a severe drought. Mountain snowpack
is at extremely low levels, and about one-fifth of the state's rivers and
streams are at record low levels.Eastern Washington has been experiencing
temperatures into the 100s, and last week Washington Gov. Jay Inslee issued an
emergency proclamation that allows state resources to quickly be brought in to
respond to wildfires.Washington's struggles with wildfires come as Alaska, its
fellow Pacific Northwest state, is facing more and harsher wildfires this
year.In Wenatchee, the wildfire fueled by high temperatures and strong winds
roared into town Sunday afternoon. The blaze ignited in brush just outside
Wenatchee, quickly burning out of control about 120 miles east of
Seattle.Rainfall on Monday provided relief, but hot, dry conditions and wind
could challenge crews trying to get a handle on the flames that burned more than
an estimated 4 square miles, officials said. Three firefighters suffered minor
injuries, but no injuries to residents were reported.Fire crews were
concentrating on preventing any more homes from being burned Monday, State
Patrol Trooper Brian Moore said. Crews were working to put out hot spots in
already burned areas, while keeping an eye on winds that were expected to reach
15 to 20 mph Monday evening and could fan flames again.Tom Bryant surveyed the
smoldering ruins of his home in the hills above Wenatchee and said he and his
wife had to race out of the house at the last minute as the fire advanced Sunday
night.On Monday, he pointed to a Mustang sports car that was a burned wreck and
to his BMW motorcycle that was destroyed in the garage."It's going to be tough
to replace," Bryant said. "It hurts, but it's just stuff. It's painful."He was
unable to save photographs and important documents, Bryant said. "That's where
all our stuff is," he said, pointing to a burned file cabinet.Evacuations were
mainly in the north end of town and included a Wal-Mart store, the Chelan County
Emergency Management office said.The store did not burn, but several commercial
buildings were near the blaze, Washington State Patrol Trooper Darren Wright
said.Emergency management officials late Monday morning also briefly issued a
shelter-in-place order after ammonia started leaking from a fruit warehouse.
They later said it had dissipated and was no longer a threat.The Blue Bird
warehouse, which uses ammonia for cold storage, was among a few commercial
buildings to burn.Bonny, who lives just outside Wenatchee, called the speed of
the blaze "just mind-blowing."Phil Bentz, who lives on the same side of the
river as the fire, said his home hadn't been evacuated. "We were waiting for
someone to knock on the door, but they didn't come. So far, so good," Bentz
said.About noon Monday, fire trucks poured water on a burning warehouse in
downtown Wenatchee, sending big black clouds into the air over the city. Farther
north of town, scorched hillsides showed where the flames were stopped just
short of irrigated apple orchards and residential subdivisions.Officials know
the fire started in brush on the edge of town, but they are still trying to
determine what sparked it.Sweltering heat above 100 degrees, tinder-dry brush
and strong winds helped fuel it.Last month, Inslee declared a statewide drought
emergency.The railroad helped battle the blaze by spraying water from tank cars
and transferring water to firefighting trucks, he said.Hilda Emerson, 37, was
among the people who fled the flames Sunday."I went and grabbed what I could -
my computers, irreplaceable stuff, toys for my daughter - and I left," she said.
"I never had to do this before."She and her 4-year-old daughter, Nissa, spent
the night on cots set up by the Red Cross in the gymnasium of Eastmont High
School in East Wenatchee. She planned to check on her home later in the day.

Alberta has a plan to contain wildfires, but is it working?; Modern suppression
works too well, leaving aging forests ripe for disaster

BYLINE: David Staples, Edmonton Journal

SECTION: CITY; Pg. A6

LENGTH: 666 words


The Alberta government is taking the right steps to fight Alberta's inevitable
wildfires, says Tom Burton, one of four experts who led a review panel on the
2011 Slave Lake wildfire.

The panel came up with recommendations in 2012 to prevent damage from such
infernos. It proposed developing quick-response firefighting specialists, having
more widespread fire bans, forest area closures and elevated fines during
extreme weather, and also doing more work on fire prevention through the
province's FireSmart committee.

The former government took the recommendations "very seriously" and provided
more money for prevention, Burton says. The new government has also funded fire
prevention efforts, Burton says, and only made a few cuts, such as shortening
the contracts for tanker planes from 123 to 83 days.

"With the economic turnaround, we have no money," Burton says. "Some of the
recommendations had to be pulled back a little bit on being implemented."

Burton, a county councillor and volunteer firefighter in the northern Alberta
hamlet of DeBolt, says he felt a pit in his stomach when he heard the Fort
McMurray news, partly because of his knowledge of the devastating Slave Lake
fire, which destroyed 510 homes and buildings and did $700 million in damage,
and partly because his own home in rural Alberta burnt to the ground in 1982
after it was hit by lightning.

"My wife and I stood there and we watched it burn. I don't wish that even on my
worst enemy ... With Fort McMurray, it brought back a lot of those memories and
it makes me want to push harder to implement" FireSmart communities.

FireSmart uses preventive measures to reduce the wildfire threat in Alberta
while balancing the benefits of wildfire on the landscape, says the Alberta
Agriculture and Forestry website.

Burton is on a committee that grants FireSmart money to individual communities
which come up with fire prevention programs, such as thinning out the bush
around and within towns, and educating property owners on how to make their own
homes less likely to ignite. "There is a lot of requests out there but it takes
a lot of money, so you've got to be realistic as well."

In recent years, the program has had about $25 million per year in funding
requests and has been able to pay out $15 million for the most worthy projects,
Burton says. The new NDP budget called for a $6.5-million cut to FireSmart.

Limiting the damage of wildfires is crucial because such fires can't be
eliminated. In fact, Alberta is experiencing more frequent and massive wildfires
, partly because the boreal forest is changing, getting more packed with
deadfall and brush, the 2012 panel found.

In 1971, more than half of Alberta's boreal forest was deemed to be "young,"
with about a third "immature," five per cent "mature" and a small portion deemed
"over-mature." By 2011, that had changed to less than 10 per cent young, about a
quarter immature, more than 40 per cent mature, and more than 20 per cent
over-mature.

"Before major wildfire suppression programs, boreal forests historically burned
on an average cycle ranging from 50 to 200 years as a result of lightning and
humancaused wildfires," the panel found. "Wildfire is a natural part of the life
cycle of the boreal forest; many of the vegetation species, including trees, are
well adapted to large, intense wildfires ... Wildfire suppression has
significantly reduced the area burned in Alberta's boreal forest. However, due
to reduced wildfire activity, forests of Alberta are aging, which ultimately
changes ecosystems and is beginning to increase the risk of large and
potentially costly catastrophic wildfires." The goal is to contain wildfires by
10 a.m. on the day after it had first been assessed and before the fire had
consumed more than four hectares. This standard is met for the vast majority of
Alberta wildfires, but wasn't met this week in Fort McMurray.

Oregon: Simpson and Schrader Reintroduce Legislation to Fix Wildfire Budget

LENGTH: 476  words



Democratic Party has issued the following news release:


Washington, D.C. - Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson and Oregon Congressman Kurt
Schrader reintroduced legislation to make common sense changes to the federal
wildfire budget.  H.R. 167, the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which was
cosponsored by nearly 150 Members of Congress and supported by a broad coalition
of over 300 organizations in the 113th Congress, aims to make sure the way we
budget for wildfire suppression activities makes sense by ending the destructive
cycle of fire borrowing and treating catastrophic wildfires like other natural
disasters.


"There are a number of steps that we need to take to address forest health and
management issues, but fixing the wildfire suppression budget must be the first
one," said Simpson.  "Until we address this issue, anything we do to increase
needed management activities in the forests, like hazardous fuels removal,
timber harvest, conservation, or trail maintenance, will continue to be lost in
fire transfers.  Fixing the wildfire budget is the critical first step in making
our forests healthier and, ultimately, reducing the cost of wildfires in the
future."
"Treating catastrophic wildfires like other natural disasters - such as
hurricanes and tornadoes - means land management agencies can adequately prepare
for the future without jeopardizing their annual funding," said Congressman
Schrader. " Each year, critical forestry programs face unnecessary budget cuts
because they are forced to transfer funds from successful forest management
practices to pay for wildfire suppression.  Freeing up those financial resources
to enhance catastrophic fire prevention programs will ultimately reduce costs on
the federal government and help us better prevent wildfires in the future."
H.R. 167 would budget for catastrophic wildfires in the same way as other
natural disasters, like floods and hurricanes.  Under the bill, routine wildland
firefighting costs, which make up about 70% of the cost of wildfire suppression,
would be funded through the normal budgeting and appropriations process.  The
true emergency fire events, which represent about 1% of wildland fires but make
up 30% of costs, would be treated like similar major natural disasters and
funded under existing disaster programs.
"The way we currently budget for fire is costing taxpayers and destroying our
forests," said Simpson.  "Passing this legislation will have a significant and
long-term impact on both our public lands and on our budget, allowing us to
finally budget responsibly for wildfire suppression in a way that ultimately
decreases firefighting costs by mitigating fire risk and making us better
prepared for and more resilient against future fires."

Lightning sparks numerous wildfires in southeast B.C.

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 530 words


BC Wildfire Service personnel are currently responding to numerous
lightning-caused fires throughout the Arrow Fire Zone and the Kootenay Lake Fire
Zone.

None of these fires is currently threatening any structures or communities.

Three separate lightning fires started on June 26 in the Arrow Fire Zone and
each of them covers less than one hectare. BC Wildfire Service personnel are at
the site of a fire burning about 12 kilometres southwest of Nakusp, near Saddle
Bay.

Another fire is about seven kilometres northeast of Nakusp near Mount Jordan,
and fire suppression efforts there are being supported by a helicopter. The
third fire is about three kilometres northeast of New Denver, and BC Wildfire
Service personnel there are being supported by an air tanker.

Five BC Wildfire Service personnel are currently heading to a wildfire near
Blueberry Creek, about seven kilometres southwest of Castlegar. The fire was
estimated to cover less than one hectare as of the afternoon of June 27.

Three separate lightning fires started June 26 in the Kootenay Lake Fire Zone,
and each of them covers less than one hectare. One is near Trout Lake, another
is about four kilometres northwest of Queens Bay and the third is about two
kilometres northwest of Blake. Each fire has BC Wildfire Service personnel on
site and the fire northwest of Blake also has a helicopter working on it.

A 30-hectare wildfire was discovered near Bull River (about 24 kilometres
northwest of Fernie) on June 25. Twenty BC Wildfire Service personnel are
currently working on this fire with the aid of three pieces of heavy equipment.
As of the afternoon of June 27, this fire was "being held", which means that
significant fire suppression has occurred and the fire is not likely to spread
further under current conditions. There were no lightning strikes in the area
when this fire started and the cause is currently under investigation.

The BC Wildfire Service is reminding the public that unattended or abandoned
campfires can easily start a fire. This type of human-caused wildfire is
completely preventable and diverts crucial resources away from naturally
occurring wildfires.

From April 1 to June 27, 2017, the Southeast Fire Centre has responded to 26
wildfires that have burned 39 hectares. Thirteen of these fires were caused by
lightning, while the remaining 26 were human-caused. Last year on this day, a
total of 37 fires had burned 312 hectares.

The fire danger rating in most of the Southeast Fire Centre is currently
"moderate" or "high", with some areas of "extreme" fire danger in the Cranbrook
Fire Zone.

The Southeast Fire Centre extends from the U.S. border in the south to the Mica
Dam in the north and from the Okanagan Highlands and Monashee Mountains in the
west to the B.C.-Alberta border in the east. The Southeast Fire Centre includes
the Selkirk Natural Resource District and the Rocky Mountain Natural Resource
District.

on a cellphone or 1 800 663-5555 toll-free. For the latest information on

Wildfire risk remains high in Nelson

BYLINE: Will Johnson

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 407  words


It's worth repeating.

Last year wildfire experts warned the City of Nelson that there's a significant
risk the city could be razed by wildfire, and on Monday afternoon they returned
to reiterate their message and to urge action from council.

"Please leave here knowing that the risk to Nelson from wildfire is
significant," Bruce Blackwell said via phone link, while going through the
updates to their wildfire protection plan.

"The key to reducing this risk is collaboration with the RDCK, BC Parks,
utilities, licensees and other stakeholders."

He reminded the councillors that there is funding available to help reduce the
risk of wildfires through the UBCM Strategic Wildfire Protection Initiative,
through the Forest Enhancement Society and through the Columbia Basin Trust.

"Nelson is doing great work, and the community is showing provincial leadership
implementing fuel reduction projects and focusing on protecting critical
infrastructure like trestles. "

That doesn't mean local governments should "pat themselves on the back," though.

"What we've learned from Fort McMurray and other wildfire events is that there
is a significant amount of work to do, and this community is not unlike some of
these others that have had large, damaging, catastrophic fires."

Blackwell's co-author John Cathro was at the meeting in person, and invited the
councillors to look out the window of city hall towards the Big Orange Bridge -
the direction where the Sitkum fire of summer 2015 came from.

He said new approaches to wildfire management now look outside municipal
boundaries, taking into account elements such as prevailing winds and
neighbouring forests that are vulnerable to lightning strikes and dry
conditions.

That's part of the reason why collaboration is so key - municipal governments
can take care of each other by coming up with a regional strategy, and preparing
to work together if they're ever faced with another conflagration.

"The greatest risk for wildfires typically comes from outside the community.
Wildfires can travel very fast," Cathro said. "It makes sense to take a new look
at how we understand the risks of wildfire to a community. We also now have a
much better understanding of climate change."

Their community action plan has evolved to take these things into consideration,
and Cathro said the risks are growing. He recommended Nelson get ahead of the
game before it's too late.

"The time to pay attention to this is now."

Wildfire fail to earn nationals berth

BYLINE: GREG MACDONALD, Chronicle Staff

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 327  words


The Waterloo Wildfire's season is over after losing an opening round playoff
series against Quebec City in two games.

The Wildfire had been hoping to earn a berth in the national championships,
which are going to be held in Cambridge at the end of the month.

But the team ran into a hot goaltender and lost the first two games of the
best-of-three series 3-2.

"It's obviously very disappointing for the team," said Wildfire head coach Doug
Miners.

"We outplayed them for three of four periods but the (Cyclones goaltender Julie
Fleury-Roy) just stood on her head." Wildfire general manager Gerry Kraemer had
worried about the Cyclone's goaltending prior to the series, but he believed the
Wildfire could overcome it.

Waterloo had been strong against the Cyclones all season, but failed to use that
advantage in the playoffs.

In Game 1 of the series, played Saturday morning in Quebec City, Amanda
Somerville and Lindsey Vivian opened the scoring for Waterloo in the first
period, giving the Wildfire a 2-0 advantage.

But Quebec City stormed back in the second, scoring three straight goals,
including the winner.

The Wildfire was looking to regroup in the second game, played Saturday
afternoon, and send the series to a Game 3, scheduled for Sunday.

But two goals from Brianna Thompson were no match for a hat trick from Quebec
City's Chantal St-Laurent and the series was over, along with the Wildfire
season.

Overall, Miners said Waterloo did "not too bad" this season.

He lamented a wave of illness that went through the dressing room during the
Waterloo Winterfest tournament.

That tournament, where Waterloo hosted teams from the Quebec division, was
crucial to the season and with better results during those games, the Wildfire
could have hosted the playoff round.

Though the Wildfire won't be playing in the national tournament, Miners figures
he and a number of players will be taking in some of the action.

The Wildfire returns to the ice for practices in late August.

Washington: Heinrich Urges Congress to Pass Bipartisan Wildfire Funding Fix in
Senate Bill

LENGTH: 355  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Martin Heinrich has issued the following news
release:

As wildfire season rages across the West, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.),
a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today urged the
Senate to pass a wildfire funding fix included in new legislation to address
funding for floods and other natural disasters. He joined U.S. Senators Ron
Wyden (D-Ore.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) in sending a
letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Banking Committee.


A wildfire funding fix similar to the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, cosponsored
by Senator Heinrich, was included in July in legislation under consideration by
the Senate Banking Committee to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance
Program.
Just like the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, the wildfire funding fix included
in the new legislation would end the cycle of underfunding fire suppression that
currently forces federal agencies to steal from fire prevention to fight fires.

"Over the years, we have worked to fix fire borrowing in any way we could find,"
the lawmakers wrote in the letter. "Yet year after year, fire season after fire
season, the fires continue to worsen and any attempt at a fix gets snarled in
Washington politics."
"Along with the reauthorization of these flood and disaster programs, the
Committee also included a provision of great interest to us - a wildfire funding
fix. We write to strongly urge you to ensure this provision remains in the final
bill as it is considered by the Committee and in the full Senate."
The language included in the Senate flood mitigation bill from the Wildfire
Disaster Funding Act would end "fire borrowing" by funding the largest wildfires
from a similar disaster account used to fund other natural disasters.
According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the risk of flooding after
wildfires is "significantly higher" for up to five years after a wildfire. Fires
increase the risk of floods and flash flooding by wiping out trees, shrubs and
other plants that allow soil to absorb rainfall and snowmelt.

Wildfire season officially begins Mar. 1

BYLINE: Stan Ashbee, The Sunny South News

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A5

LENGTH: 576  words


According to a recent media release from the Alberta Agriculture and Forestry
department, preparations have been underway for the official start of wildfire
season, which is Mar. 1.

Agriculture and Forestry Minister Oneil Carlier noted in the media release as of
Mar. 1, fines and penalties will increase for burning activities. Mar. 1,
according to the media release, is also a reminder to Albertans to be extra
careful to help prevent wildfires in forested areas. The media release stated
more than 60 per cent of the wildfires last year were caused by human activity.

"Protecting Albertans from the threat of wildfire is one of our highest
priorities. That's why we legislated Mar. 1, as the start of fire season,
recognizing recent trends show wildfires are starting earlier in the spring. The
wildfire that burned into Fort McMurray last year serves as a reminder of how
important it is for us to be ready to respond to wildfires at a moment's
notice," stated Carlier in the media release.

Last year, according to the media release, 1,338 wildfires burned more than
611,000 hectares, including the Horse River wildfire that spread into Fort
McMurray. The new Forest and Prairie Protection Act, the media release pointed
out, increases penalties for abandoning campfires or burning during fire bans
and improves the government's ability to restrict higher-risk activities, such
as fireworks and incendiary targets during hazardous fire conditions.

Darryl Beaton, Lethbridge County's emergency services co-ordinator said with the
official start of the provincial fire season Mar. 1, Albertans are reminded of
how fast fire hazard conditions in the county can change from low to extreme.

"We are also reminded of the damage wildfire can cause when looking back at Fort
McMurray, Slave Lake and our own grass fire events of 2011 and 2012," Beaton
said.

Beaton added in the interest of public safety, the county would like to remind
everyone to follow regulations in the Fire Permit Bylaw and the Fire Ban Bylaw.

"Please adhere to the conditions on your fire permit and pay close attention to
the weather and the conditions of the fuels around you," said Beaton.

Fire Ban information is current and is posted on the home page of the Lethbridge
County website at lethcounty.ca and on the Alberta Fire Ban website at
albertafirebans.ca.

The Fire Ban Bylaw #1423 and the Fire Permit Bylaw #1424 can be found on the
county's website at lethcounty.ca/government/bylaws. Fire Permits are also
available, free of charge, from the home page on the county's website.

"If you have any questions regarding the regulations or what you can do to help
prevent the spread of wildfire, please contact the county Emergency Services
Department at mail@lethcounty.ca or call 403-328-5525," Beaton said. Tips to
prevent a wildfire: * Make sure your campfire is out - soak it, stir it, and
soak it again * Keep an eye on any winter burning Report a wildfire. Call
310-FIRE (3473) if you spot a wildfire. These calls ensure fire crews can
respond as quickly as possible.

According to the recent media release, with the start of fire season, fire
permits will be required for any burning, outside of campfires, in the Forest
Protection Area of Alberta. This will allow firefighters to address any winter
burning before the spring.

Fire permits are free and can be obtained by contacting your local Alberta
Agriculture and Forestry office. Phone toll-free 310-0000 to locate your nearest
office.

Hundreds of wildfires are raging in British Columbia, Alberta, Quebec and the
Northwest Territories while the U.S. is battling large blazes in Arizona,
Nevada, Utah, Idaho, California, Colorado, Florida, Washington state and New
Mexico. Canada has already had more than 2,000 wildfires this year. And this
week saw U.S. President Barack Obama ask Congress for $615-million to help fight
the fires this season.

So where are the hotspots in North America and how do those fires start and
spread?

A 4,500-hectare fire has forced the evacuation of 200 people. The worry is that
winds will push the flames east.

At least 130 fires are burning across the Northwest Territories, more than half
of them north and south of Great Slave Lake. They have closed highways and two
territorial parks, prompted fire bans, and forced one community - Kakisa, pop.
50 - to be evacuated for a week.

The largest wildfire in Alberta is being contained by firefighters at just over
1,500 hectares.

A 400-hectare wildfire is forcing evacuations near Lake Spokane as flames
threaten more than 60 buildings.

Environment Canada issued a special air quality statement for all of
Saskatchewan because of smoke from the wildfires in N.W.T. and Banff.

WILDFIRES BY CAUSE U.S. WILDFIRES AS REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL INTERAGENCY
COORDINATION CENTER, BASED ON A 13-YEAR AVERAGE, 2001-13

Human-caused wildfires These account for the majority of wildfires started each
year. Causes can include camp fires, cigarette butts, sparks from train wheels
and arson. On average, human-caused wildfires burn 10,117.1 sq. km per year - an
area nearly twice as large as Prince Edward Island (5,660 sq. km).

Starts: 62,631

Area burned: 10,117.1 sq. km

Lightning-caused wildfires Fewer wildfires are caused by lightning strikes each
year, yet typically they cause more damage, as there is not always someone to
report the fires. On average, lightning-caused fires burn 16,592.1 sq. km per
year - an area larger than the state of Connecticut (14,357 sq. km).

Starts:10,000

Area burned: 16,592.1 sq. km

FIGHTING FOREST FIRES

On the ground, crews of firefighters douse the fire with water and fire
retardant. Other crews may work to create firebreaks around the fire to keep it
from spreading. A firebreak is a tract of land that has been stripped of any
possible fuel for the fire. Ground crews may also use backfires - they start
fires that advance toward the burning wildfire. The goal is to burn up any
potential fuel in its path.

In the air, helicopters may be used as a method of attacking the fire - dropping
buckets that can hold hundreds of litres of water. Helicopters are also valuable
for transporting firefighters to and from the fire. Waterbombers such as the
Bombardier 415 Superscooper may be called in to fight larger fires.

WATER SCOOPING

The Bombardier 415 collects water by skimming along the surface of a lake, or
other body of water, and scooping it up. Filling the 415's tanks takes only 12
seconds, travelling at 130 km/h and a distance of 410 metres. The aircraft can
scoop water from sites that are only two metres deep and 90 metres wide.

ANATOMY OF A FOREST FIRE

FUEL LOADS

Wildfires spread based on the type and quantity of fuel that surrounds them.
This can include everything from trees, underbrush and dry grassy fields to
homes. The amount of flammable material that surrounds a fire is referred to as
the fuel load. Fuel load is measured by the amount of available fuel per unit
area, usually tons per acre.

Fire retardant

A chemical retardant containing phosphate fertilizer, which helps to slow and
cool down the fire, can be added to the water. This will make the dropped water
apppear red.

Water tank

Twin internal water tanks can hold up to 6,137 litres of water.

Tank doors

Four hydraulic tank doors open to release the water onto its target. Pilots
control which doors open and how quickly to adjust the drop pattern.

Probes

Two retractable probes under the aircraft scoop the water into the tanks using
only the velocity of the aircraft. Each probe is only 12.7cm wide.

WEATHER

Weather plays a major role in the birth, growth and death of a wildfire. Drought
leads to extremely favourable conditions while rain raises the amount of
moisture in fuels, which suppresses potential blazes.

TOPOGRAPHY

Topography can either aid or hinder wildfire progression. The most important
factor in topography as it relates to wildfire is slope. The steeper the slope,
the faster the fire travels. Fires travel in the direction of the ambient wind,
which usually flows uphill. Additionally, the fire can preheat the fuel further
up the hill because the smoke and heat are rising in that direction. Conversely,
once the fire has reached the top of a hill, it must struggle to come back down
because it is not able to preheat the downhill fuel as well as the uphill.

Tree crown fuel Tree crown fires are so intense, they're difficult to control.

WIND

Wind is the most unpredictable factor in a wildfire's behaviour. It supplies
additional oxygen, further dries potential fuel, and pushes the fire across the
land faster.

HEAT

Temperature affects the sparking of wildfires. The sticks, trees and underbrush
on the ground receive radiant heat from the sun, which heats and dries potential
fuels. For this reason, wildfires tend to rage in the afternoon, when
temperatures are at their hottest.

Surface fuel The main variable in ignition time is the ratio of the fuel's total
surface area to its volume. Since a twig's surface area is not much larger than
its volume, it ignites quickly. By comparison, a tree's surface area is much
smaller than its volume, so it needs more time to heat up before it ignites.

Ladder fuel Ladder fuel allows the fire to move up toward the tree tops.

Researchers discover how wildfires create their own weather

LENGTH: 585  words




Virginia: The National Science Foundation has issued the following news release:

Scientists working close to the line of wildfires are obtaining a new
understanding of the fires' smoke plumes. The results are providing real-time
information, such as vertical wind profiles, to firefighters battling blazes.


Through this National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded research, Craig Clements,
a meteorologist at San José State University (SJSU), and researcher Neil Lareau,
also of SJSU, have discovered that wildfires can create their own weather,
leading to extreme fire behavior.
In a paper recently published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and
Climatology, the scientists report findings from inside wildfire plumes,
information previously obtained only from computer simulations.
"This research offers rare observations of the behavior of wildfire smoke
plumes," says Nick Anderson, program director in NSF's Division of Atmospheric
and Geospace Sciences, which supported the research. "Improved understanding of
wildfire plumes is important for determining whether smoke will stay near the
ground and affect air quality and visibility, or whether it will rise into the
atmosphere and potentially affect clouds and the amount of sunlight reaching the
ground."
The SJSU researchers mounted Doppler LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging, a
remote-sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure
distances) instruments onto a pickup truck, which they placed near wildfires.
"Until now," says Clements, "it has been difficult to sample wildfires with such
sophisticated instruments because of logistical and safety concerns."
The team overcame that by obtaining firefighter credentials, which allowed them
access to active wildfires, and by using a nimble, truck-mounted system that
could be rapidly deployed. "Our work is providing new information about
fire-atmosphere interactions and how wildfires spread," says Clements.
In addition to conducting research at active wildfires in the western U.S., the
scientists performed controlled field experiments, setting fires and monitoring
their rapid spread through an array of atmospheric instrumentation.
These studies gave the researchers information on how wildfires create their own
weather systems. Those weather systems, in turn, fuel extreme fire behavior.
In their journal paper, the scientists present observations from the El Portal
Fire of July, 2014, in Yosemite National Park, California.
The results revealed vigorous, fire-generated updrafts, says Clements, and
strongly turbulent eddies that formed along the fire plume's edges. The data
also showed that fire-modified winds extended more than one mile from the fire
itself.
The findings confirm longstanding, but previously unvalidated, predictions for
how plumes rise from fires, and offer new insights into the processes that
control how high and how far wildfire smoke will spread.
In addition to the El Portal Fire, the team has studied 22 other large wildfires
in the western U.S.
"We're seeing a large number of fires," says Clements. "Many are extreme in
terms of intensity. Higher-intensity fires cause deeper plumes, which can help
spread fires by lofting embers and causing spot fires.
"That situation is dangerous for both firefighters and communities that are in
the paths of fires -- like those in British Columbia and California this summer.
We need more sophisticated models to better predict fire behavior, especially in
a changing climate."

High winds threaten progress against California wildfires

BYLINE:  Associated Press

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A19

LENGTH: 703 words


SONOMA, Calif. - The California wildfires raced toward wineries and the historic
town of Sonoma on Saturday, chasing hundreds more people from their homes and
threatening to roll back firefighters' modest gains against the cluster of
blazes that was as wide as 100 miles.

Propelled by stiff wind, the fires damaged or destroyed several buildings in the
middle of the night before crews halted their advance at the edge of Sonoma,
where firefighters spent days digging firebreaks to keep flames from reaching
the city's historic central plaza built centuries ago when the area was under
Spanish rule.

For those living in the huge fire zone, it was another night spent watching,
waiting and fearing the worst.

John Saguto said he awoke several hours before dawn to see flames "lapping up"
300 to 500 yards away. He and his neighbors evacuated as firetrucks raced up and
down the streets and hot embers flew over their heads.

The fire made "a strong run" into Sonoma, Deputy State Fire Director Dave Teter
said, announcing that some additional buildings had been damaged or destroyed
before firefighters stopped it.

Nearly a week after the blazes began, the flames have left 38 people dead and
destroyed at least 5,700 homes and businesses, making them the deadliest and
most destructive group of wildfires in California history.

Most of the victims are believed to have died on late on Oct. 8 or early on Oct.
9, when the fires exploded and took people by surprise in the dead of night.
Most of the victims were elderly, though they ranged in age from 14 to 100.

"It's a horror that no one could have imagined," Gov. Jerry Brown said, after
touring the destruction with Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris. Brown,
79, and Feinstein, 84, said the fires were the worst of their lifetimes.

The latest estimates were that about 100,000 people were under evacuation orders
as the fires burned for a sixth day.

Some evacuees weary from nearly a week on the run demanded to return home or to
see if they still have homes. Plans were in the works to reopen communities, but
they were not ready to be put into effect, Teter said.

Douglas and Marian Taylor stood outside their apartment complex Saturday in
Santa Rosa with their two dogs and a sign that said "End evacuation now."

Their building was unharmed at the edge of the evacuation zone with a police
barricade set up across the street. The couple said they are spending about $300
per day to rent a motel and eat out, and they want to return home because the
fire does not appear to threaten their home.

At an evacuation center at the fairgrounds in the Sonoma County city of
Petaluma, volunteers sorted through mounds of donated baby wipes, diapers,
pillows, shoes and clothing.

Life away from home has been difficult and dangerous. Randy Chiado said a man
who may have suspected he was a looter tried to punch him through his car window
and yelled for a friend to get a gun when the Chiados turned onto a residential
street after they evacuated their home. He said he was able to push the man off
and drive away.

The couple planned to spend the night with other evacuees in a room set up with
cots. "It's like jail," he said.

Jack Weaver and his brother-in-law Patrick Widen walked around police
barricades, through a creek and up treacherous hilly roads to save Weaver's
mother from the grim task of recovering the body of the family's beloved dog
Izzy, a 9-year-old Bernese mountain dog. But then Izzy suddenly came bounding
out for a joyous reunion.

Jack Weaver captured the moment on his phone in a video that's gone viral on
Facebook, providing a rare bit of good news amid endless scenes of severe
destruction.

"She was very happy to see us," Weaver said.

In all, 17 large fires still burned across the northern part of the state, with
more than 10,000 firefighters attacking the flames using air tankers,
helicopters and more than 1,000 fire engines.

The erratic fires have threatened several neighborhoods more than once.

Judy Guttridge evacuated for the second time after her daughter saw flames
advancing over the side of a hill and told the family to get out.

"I have good insurance, everything," she said. "All the kids, grandkids,
great-grandkids are fine. I'm OK with that."

EDITORIAL: High snowpack is great, but no guarantee to stop wildfires

BYLINE: Walla Walla Union-Bulletin, Wash.

SECTION: COMMENTARY

LENGTH: 368 words


Feb. 21--This winter's mountain snowpack is fabulous.

Winter snowpack was 109 percent of normal across Washington state, according to
a Feb. 1 report from the Natural Resources Conservation Service. Some areas came
in just below 70 percent, while others ranked close to 150 percent of normal.

The snowpack feeding the Walla Walla River basin was about 20 percent above
normal last week, Marilyn Lohmann, a hydrologist with the National Weather
Service office in Pendleton, told the Union-Bulletin. Year-to-date precipitation
is about 9 percent above average.

The higher-than-normal snowpack has aided hopes this summer will not be a repeat
of last year's drought conditions that were a factor in the worst wildfire
season in history.

While the extra water that will flow from the melting mountains certainly help
reduce the chance of wildfires, it's no guarantee this region is safe. A variety
of factors contribute to wildfires, from unreasonably high temperatures to the
amount of dried grass and wood that serve as fuel.

Given that, state and federal governments can't retreat from the goal of putting
a long-term plan for wildfire prevention and suppression in place.

U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell, who visited the fire camps in
Washington state last summer, said wildfires need to be funded as disasters.

She said this would leave fire prevention budgets in place at the state level
for thinning dense forest stands, rehabilitating areas after wildfires and
making sure communities are more resilient to fire.

It was a fantastic idea then, and it remains so now.

Unfortunately, as government budgets get tight (as they are in Washington, D.C.,
and Olympia), money once targeted for wildfires is eyed for other needs because
the danger of wildfires has been reduced this year. This is an ongoing threat,
not a one-time concern.

It's critical government learn from the wildfire disaster of 2015.

Forest Service mobilizes modular airborne firefighting systems

BYLINE: The Portola Reporter staff

LENGTH: 619  words


The U.S. Forest Service is mobilizing two Department of Defense C-130s equipped
with modular airborne firefighting systems, known as MAFFS, to assist with
wildfire suppression efforts in Colorado and elsewhere in the West as needed.

The systems will be provided by the 302nd Airlift Wing, Air Force Reserve,
Peterson Air Force Base, Colo. They will be based in Colorado Springs, Colo.,
and will begin flying wildfire suppression missions as soon as safe and
effective operations can be established.

"We are experiencing an uptick in wildfire activity and we are mobilizing MAFFS
to ensure that we have adequate air tanker capability as we confront explosive
wildfire conditions in Colorado, New Mexico and elsewhere in the West," said
U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell. "Maintaining adequate aerial firefighting
capability is critical to provide support to, and enhance the safety of, the
firefighters on the ground who are working so hard to suppress wildfires that
are threatening lives, homes, infrastructure and valuable natural and cultural
resources."

Modular airborne firefighting systems are portable fire retardant delivery
systems that can be inserted into military C-130 aircraft to convert them into
large airtankers when needed. Military C-130s equipped with the systems can drop
up to 3,000 gallons of fire retardant on wildfires. They can discharge their
entire load in under five seconds or make variable drops.

Airtankers are used in wildfire suppression to deliver fire retardant to reduce
the intensity and slow the growth of wildfires so that firefighters on the
ground can construct containment lines safely, which is how wildfires are
suppressed. Fire retardant is not typically used to suppress wildfires directly.
Professional fire managers decide whether to use airtankers to deliver fire
retardant, and where to use them, based on the objectives they have established
to manage wildfires and the strategies they are using to achieve them.
Airtankers are not requested for all wildfires.

The modular airborne firefighting systems program is a joint effort between the
U.S. Forest Service and Department of Defense that has been in place for 40
years. The U.S. Forest Service owns the MAFFS equipment and supplies the
retardant, while the Department of Defense provides the C-130 aircraft, flight
crews and maintenance, and support personnel to fly the missions.

The U.S. Forest Service has a total of eight modular airborne firefighting
systems ready for operational use.

Military installations in Wyoming, North Carolina, California and Colorado
provide C-130s to fly the missions. Specifically, the 153rd Airlift Wing,
Wyoming Air National Guard, Cheyenne; the 145th Airlift Wing, North Carolina Air
National Guard, Charlotte; the 146th Airlift Wing, California Air National
Guard, Port Hueneme; and the 302nd Airlift Wing, Air Force Reserve, Peterson Air
Force Base, Colorado Springs.

In 2012, modular airborne firefighting systems delivered 2.4 million gallons of
fire retardant during wildfire suppression missions in Colorado, Wyoming, South
Dakota, Montana, Utah, Idaho, Oregon, California and Nevada. That was the second
busiest year for the systems in at least the last 20 years. 1994 was the busiest
year, when they delivered more than 5 million gallons of fire retardant during
wildfire suppression missions.

Over the last 10 years, military C-130s equipped with modular airborne
firefighting systems have delivered a total of approximately 8.5 million gallons
of retardant on wildfires, an average of about 850,000 gallons per year.

Each year, an average of nearly 75,000 wildfires burn an average of more than 7
million acres of private, state and federal land in the United States.

Dry season expected to fuel wildfires in southern NM

BYLINE: By Bryan Kirk Sun-News reporter

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 444 words


LAS CRUCES   Summer is still a month away, but state and local fire officials
are already gearing up for what could be a busier-than-normal wildfire season.

The National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, reported Tuesday that
broad areas of the United States, could see an increased risk of wildfires.

The forecast, which focused on areas of the U.S. experiencing lingering drought
and the anticipated onset of a hotter-than-normal summer, indicated areas of
Southern New Mexico and West Texas could be at high risk for wildfires.

"We've had a number of red-flag days," said Steve Bumgarner, spokesperson for
the Bureau of Land Management in Las Cruces.

While New Mexico and Texas could see their fair share of wildfires, areas of
Georgia, Florida, and even Alaska could also be affected.

"One thing that strikes me is the breadth of the fire season, stretching from
Florida and Georgia all the way up to Alaska," said Rick Ochoa, national fire
weather program manager at the center.

The National Wildfire Outlook report, which predicts wildfire danger from May to
August, is based on past and expected weather patterns, as well as the
anticipated level of dryness of fire fuels.

Tom Wordell, wildland fire analyst at the center, said the predictions look
similar to last year's wildfire season, which saw a record 9.8 million acres
burned and resulted in the deaths of 24 firefighters.

Bumgarner said he is taking the wildfire forecast seriously, and as a result,
has begun augmenting the fire fighting force.

"We are beefing up," he said.

The BLM in Las Cruces has received the help of an engine crew from Nevada and
they are also working with the 66 volunteer fire departments within a six-county
region.

"They are our first line of defense," Bumgarner said.

The BLM, which helps protect about 5.5 million acres in southwestern New Mexico,
has already seen the first signs of an active wildfire season.

"There has been an increase in the number of fires," Bumgarner said.

Within the last 60 days, wildfires have scorched about 700 acres in grassland.

Dan Ware, spokesperson for the New Mexico Forestry Division, said he is also
aware of the wildfire forecast, and he believes there are adequate resources
available to combat the predicted wildfire threat.

"We keep a readiness in New Mexico. Unless it is raining or snowing, you can
have a fire at any time," he said.

However, even with that level of preparedness, education and cooperation are
still vital.

As the weather gets hotter, Ware said fire crews will begin patrolling high-risk
areas and educating those who could be affected.

"We have a good system set up," he said.

Washington: More Logging Needed to Combat Wildfires, California Official Says

LENGTH: 606  words



The Heartland Institute has issued the following news release:

Western states have faced severe wildfire seasons in recent years. This year was
no exception, prompting officials in many states to bemoan the growing threats
wildfires pose to the environment and economy. A multi-year drought in the
region has resulted in 14 wildfires scorching more than 183 square miles of
timber and brush along the borders of California and Oregon.

Amid the destruction and millions of dollars spent, officials are analyzing how
best to reduce and fight the number and severity of wildfires, including logging
as an option.

Senate Wildfire Hearings

On July 15 the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing
on wildfires and pending legislation that would reform funding for wildfire
suppression.

The "Wildfire Preparedness & Forest Service 2015 Fiscal Year Budget" hearing
featured legislators, officials from local forestry departments, and federal
land managers. It highlighted two pending bills addressing funding: the FLAME
Act Amendments of 2014 (S.2593) and the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act (S.1875).

Catastrophic "mega-fires" make up only 1 percent of wildfires but take up nearly
30 percent of the entire fire suppression budget. The FLAME Act Amendments of
2014 would prohibit federal agencies from dipping into the fire prevention funds
to fight emergency fires, known as "fire borrowing." The bill also redirects
more funds to hazardous-fuel reduction projects and provides financial
incentives to undertake more active forest management plans which could include
logging, brush clearing and reforesting.

The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would create a special disaster fund to fight
specifically to fight "mega-fires". This fund would curtail the raiding fire
prevention funds to pay for emergency firefighting efforts.

"The Nature Conservancy supports the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act in the House
[H.R. 3992] and Senate. This bill is a budget fix for the Interior
appropriations bill that would fund fires that are disasters in the same way as
other natural disasters," said Cecilia Clavet, a senior policy advisor at the
Nature Conservancy.

State Officials Advocate Logging

Some officials are advocating allowing logging to thin forests in order to
reduce the number of fires.

In California, in the aftermath of the Rim Fire, which blackened 400 square
miles of the Stanislaus National Forest, Susan Skalski, supervisor of the
Stanislaus National Forest, proposed logging trees destroyed by the fire.

Her proposal, finalized on August 28, has environmental groups upset about the
approval of 24 square miles of burned mountain range for logging. In addition,
logging would be permitted on 28 square miles along roads over which trees are
expected to fall and threaten safety.

The California Forestry Association commended the U.S. Forest Service for
putting together a sound Environmental Impact Statement in an open and
transparent process.

"Our members are eager to see treatments implemented that help restore the
burned areas of the forest and that reduce threats to public safety posed by the
standing dead trees created by the fire," President David Bischel said in a
statement.

"The Conservancy also supports increasing forest management activities, like
restoration, that help improve forest health and reduce the risk and costs of
wildfires. Fixing the fire funding portion of wildfires through the Wildfire
Disaster Funding Act will allow for more restoration activities to take place,"
Clavet said.

Storm debris increases wildfire danger

SECTION: NEWCOMERS' GUIDE; Pg. 16D

LENGTH: 590  words


Hurricanes and wildfires don't seem to go together, but the aftermath of recent
tropical storms have forestry officials concerned.

After all the storms and rain . . . most Floridians might think the threat of
wildfires has been reduced, but in fact the opposite is true," said Timber
Weller, a wildfire mitigation specialist with the Florida Division of Forestry
in Bunnell. "One of the legacies of the hurricanes may be an elevated wildfire
risk lasting several years."

Unlike populated areas, where hurricane debris was quickly cleaned up and hauled
away, debris from the storms in wooded areas is extra fuel making it more likely
for wildfires to start and more difficult to put out.

Remember what your neighborhood looked like right after the storm, leaves and
twigs blanketed the ground, trees stripped and branches large and small
everywhere," Weller said. "Visualize the huge piles of plant debris produced by
a single neighborhood and then multiply that by the hundreds of thousands of
acres of forests throughout Florida."

While May and June are the peak months for wildfires, Weller said the reality is
that Florida has a year-round burn season.

'If we get rain frequently enough we don't have a problem," he said. "If we
don't get rain we do have a problem and it doesn't matter what month is on the
calendar."

Weller said in addition to the larger amount of potential fuel for fires, large
logs and other debris make it harder for forestry crews to operate equipment in
the woods.

There's more fuel available and it's going to be more difficult to operate," he
said. "It's going to be tougher."

But there are things homeowners can do to prepare for wildfire season, said Bill
Butler, Palm Coast landscape architect.

The first thing I would say is if homeowners have any debris on their site, get
them out to the street so the refuse company can pick it up," Butler said. "The
important thing is the area around the house. That's the area homeowners need to
focus on."

Homeowners can take precautions to limit the chances of damage from wildfires,
including: * Remove leaves, pine straw and debris from roof and rain gutters. *
Create "defensible" space by removing or reducing flammable material near
buildings and provide at least 30 feet of buffer space between house and
potential wildfire fuels. * Landscape with nonflammable mulch and choose plants
that have high moisture content. Healthy, well-irrigated plants are more
resistant to burning.

When it comes down to it, there is just a brief period when a home is exposed to
wildfire," Weller said. "If the home can defend itself, it will survive and the
wildfire will move on."

Weller said efforts by the Division of Forestry to reduce wildfire risks have
paid off in recent years.

We've seen a reduction in the number of fires over the last couple of years," he
said. But, he said, the risks are still there. And that is why homeowners need
to take positive measures to protect themselves.

We know we're going to have more fires," he said. "We don't know if we have to
have more catastrophes."

Washington: Researchers discover how wildfires create their own weather

LENGTH: 585  words



Washington: National Science Foundation has issued the following house news
release:

Scientists working close to the line of wildfires are obtaining a new
understanding of the fires' smoke plumes. The results are providing real-time
information, such as vertical wind profiles, to firefighters battling blazes.


Through this National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded research, Craig Clements,
a meteorologist at San José State University (SJSU), and researcher Neil Lareau,
also of SJSU, have discovered that wildfires can create their own weather,
leading to extreme fire behavior.
In a paper recently published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and
Climatology, the scientists report findings from inside wildfire plumes,
information previously obtained only from computer simulations.
"This research offers rare observations of the behavior of wildfire smoke
plumes," says Nick Anderson, program director in NSF's Division of Atmospheric
and Geospace Sciences, which supported the research. "Improved understanding of
wildfire plumes is important for determining whether smoke will stay near the
ground and affect air quality and visibility, or whether it will rise into the
atmosphere and potentially affect clouds and the amount of sunlight reaching the
ground."
The SJSU researchers mounted Doppler LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging, a
remote-sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure
distances) instruments onto a pickup truck, which they placed near wildfires.
"Until now," says Clements, "it has been difficult to sample wildfires with such
sophisticated instruments because of logistical and safety concerns."
The team overcame that by obtaining firefighter credentials, which allowed them
access to active wildfires, and by using a nimble, truck-mounted system that
could be rapidly deployed. "Our work is providing new information about
fire-atmosphere interactions and how wildfires spread," says Clements.
In addition to conducting research at active wildfires in the western U.S., the
scientists performed controlled field experiments, setting fires and monitoring
their rapid spread through an array of atmospheric instrumentation.
These studies gave the researchers information on how wildfires create their own
weather systems. Those weather systems, in turn, fuel extreme fire behavior.
In their journal paper, the scientists present observations from the El Portal
Fire of July, 2014, in Yosemite National Park, California.
The results revealed vigorous, fire-generated updrafts, says Clements, and
strongly turbulent eddies that formed along the fire plume's edges. The data
also showed that fire-modified winds extended more than one mile from the fire
itself.
The findings confirm longstanding, but previously unvalidated, predictions for
how plumes rise from fires, and offer new insights into the processes that
control how high and how far wildfire smoke will spread.
In addition to the El Portal Fire, the team has studied 22 other large wildfires
in the western U.S.
"We're seeing a large number of fires," says Clements. "Many are extreme in
terms of intensity. Higher-intensity fires cause deeper plumes, which can help
spread fires by lofting embers and causing spot fires.
"That situation is dangerous for both firefighters and communities that are in
the paths of fires -- like those in British Columbia and California this summer.
We need more sophisticated models to better predict fire behavior, especially in
a changing climate."

Only you can prevent forest fires

BYLINE: Joseph Quigley, Mayerthorpe Freelancer

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. A4

LENGTH: 490  words


The awe at the devastation and chaos of forest fires needs to match the awe at
the foolishness of the people that cause them.

The Fort McMurray forest fire is a prominent example of the need for this. This
month, people are reflecting on the destruction of the blaze and how much work
still needs to be done in its wake. But the precise cause of the fire is still
unknown, other than the likelihood it was the result of human activity.

This, and the thousands of humanmade wildfires that will spring up over this
year in Alberta, costing us millions, are a constant reminder of human
ignorance. The damage they cause stresses the ongoing need to make that
ignorance a focal point in addressing wildfires.

In 2015, the most recent year in which data is available, 57 per cent of
wildfires in Alberta were man-made according to Alberta Wildfire. That
percentage has remained fairly steady for the past decade, with humans remaining
the majority cause for wildfires within the province and beyond.

It is startling that this remains such a persistent problem, despite the yearly
damage of wildfires. Although many such human-caused wildfires are small and
dealt with quickly, doing less damage overall than lightning-caused fires, there
is an everpresent risk for these to spread and cause significant damage, which
the entire country bared witness to in Fort McMurray. That human-caused
incidents of wildfire can be prevented by fairly simple fire-management methods
makes their continued presence all the more incredible.

The risk of significant damage makes tackling man-made wildfires at the source a
worthwhile effort, a step government has been willing to take. The Government of
Alberta recently stepped up penalties on people engaging in behaviour leading to
wildfires in an effort to try to curtail this. Locally-based programs such as
FireSmart also go a long way in combating the ignorance that leads to wildfires.

But human-made wildfires continue despite the efforts of government officials.
Years of advocacy efforts and government programs can only go so far to this
problem, when all it takes is one individual or thoughtless action to cause
disaster.

The entire populace needs to band together to prevent human-made forest fires.
As a nation, we had an incredibly compassionate response to the tragedy of Fort
McMurray and united to help those in need. Alberta rightfully celebrated the
power of that unity. It should be comparatively simple for us to unite in a
commitment to doing everything we can to prevent something like this fire from
ever happening again.

Do your part to prevent the fanning of flames. Keep control of recreational
fires and follow fire bans. Listen intently to best fire safety practices
provided to us by our governments and first responders. Be vigilant and do not
take risks by being lethargic in fire safety.

As a wise bear once said, "only you can prevent forest fires," and it is the
very least you could do.

Washington: Gardner Urges Congressional Leaders to Support Wildfire Funding

LENGTH: 671  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Senator Cory Gardner has issued the following
news release:

Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) joined Senate Western Caucus colleagues in sending a
letter on Wednesday to Congressional leadership urging their support for
wildfire reforms that will assist Colorado and other Western states that have
experienced severe damage from several years of destructive wildfire seasons.



This letter follows Gardner's action on wildfire funding two weeks ago when he
introduced the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act of 2017, legislation that would end
the destructive cycle of fire borrowing and stop the erosion of the Forest
Service's budget by reforming the way the federal government funds wildfires.

The letter reads in full:

Dear Speaker Ryan and Leaders McConnell, Schumer and Pelosi:

As members of the Senate Western Caucus, we write to bring attention to this
year's terrible wildfire season and ask for your support in prioritizing and
passing critically-needed forest management and wildfire funding reforms in
legislation that becomes law this year.

Wildfires across much of the West this year have been severe. Over 8.5 million
acres--larger than the state of Maryland--have burned to date, hundreds of homes
and other structures have been lost, emissions and dangerous particulates from
the fires have threatened public health in many communities, and, worst of all,
two wildland firefighters have died. In addition, the Forest Service has already
spent well over $2 billion to suppress the fires. The terrible fire season and
its widespread consequences is not an anomaly, unfortunately. In fact, this is
the fifth time in ten years that more than seven million acres have burned.
Congress must act now to solve both the budget and management problems
associated with wildfires.

We will never be able to prevent all wildfires or address all of the factors
that contribute to fire. Congress can, however, take meaningful steps to
increase the capacity of the Forest Service and other federal land management
agencies to improve forest management and reduce wildfire risk. We therefore
urge passage of comprehensive reforms that together would substantially increase
the pace and scale of forest management, reducing the size and severity of
catastrophic wildfire. We ask for reforms that:

    Cut unnecessary red tape that needlessly slows down projects that would
improve forest health. We support additional streamlining of project planning,
such as analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act, that builds on the
2014 Farm Bill provisions and other authorities and ensures a larger scope of
projects developed through a collaborative process can be implemented swiftly.


    Combat litigation from fringe groups that continues to delay or outright
stop much-needed projects. Many of these lawsuits are against projects that were
locally developed by diverse stakeholders, including mainstream
conservationists, and thereby are undermining the very kind of collaborative
management that both Congress and the Forest Service have expressly encouraged.


    End fire borrowing and address the growing costs of wildfire suppression in
a fiscally responsible manner.

In addition to improving forest health and reducing wildfire risk, it is
important to note that these reforms would also create wood products jobs,
provide revenues to forested counties, improve fish and wildlife habitat,
protect at-risk watersheds and improve water quality, enhance carbon
sequestration within our National Forests, and increase recreational
opportunities on public lands. The benefits of increasing active forest
management are therefore both extensive and integrated, and they are critical to
the livelihoods and quality of life of the residents of our Western states and
the experience of millions of tourists.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this critical matter. We are eager to
work with you on developing specific management and funding provisions and
enacting them before the year ends.

FEMA grant to fuel ongoing work of Boulder County's Wildfire Partners

BYLINE: Charlie Brennan Staff Writer

SECTION: NEWS

Alexandra Witze and Jeff Kanipe bought their house in the Boulder Heights
subdivision in 2010. A few months later, the Fourmile Fire stormed within two
miles of their doorstep.


That  got their attention.

 So when the  Wildfire Partners program was launched last year, giving Boulder
County homeowners a chance to get an assessment by a wildfire mitigation
specialist and  a customized report on their home's vulnerabilities -- along
with financial awards and possible reduction in insurance costs -- the couple
was  ready.



 "It was a bit of a shock to move here and experience that within a couple of
months," Witze said of the Fourmile inferno. "When Wildfire Partners started
out, we decided it would be a good opportunity to get more advice about what we
could do to better protect our house."

 On Tuesday, the couple's home was certified for their completed mitigation
work, which will entitle them, they expect, to about $300 reimbursement under
the Wildfire Partners program for the roughly $3,000 they spent since a first
consultation with program representatives in May 2014.

 "Of course everything they suggested was, we could take it or leave it," Witze
said. "It was more information for us to think about. Just because they say we
should do it, doesn't mean we had to."

 But to earn Wildfire Partner's certification, they did agree to a series of
steps that included taking down several of their ponderosa pines, clearing out
an area under the deck of their 2,000-square-foot home and, most notably,
putting in a 3-foot perimeter of crushed rock around the exterior of their
residence.

 "We talked a lot about whether we wanted to do that or not," Witze said. "But
we decided to do it. It just seemed safer to have that there, rather than grass
right up around the side. We went with it in the end, and we were happy we did."


 Chance to increase home's insurability



 Wildfire Partners is happy these days, too, having just secured a $1.125
million grant by from the  Hazard Mitigation Grant Program of the Federal
Emergency Management Administration. That helps augment a previous $1.5 million
grant from the  Colorado Department of Natural Resources.

 "This is a tremendous opportunity for Boulder County residents who want to
perform wildfire mitigation, because it offers significant financial assistance
and strong technical support," said Jim Webster, Wildfire Partners program
coordinator.

 "What's really unique is working with the insurance industry; Wildfire Partners
is an opportunity to increase the insurability of their home. That provides real
value to homeowners, because people want insurance."

 Kanipe said she and her husband would soon be contacting their insurance
company to see how their rates might be adjusted downward in light of their
successful certification.

 Abby Silver, a wildfire mitigation specialist with Wildfire Partners, said she
has conducted about 160 home assessments in the program's first two years --
including the evaluation of the Witze/Kanipe property.

 "Generally the feedback we've gotten from the people is extremely positive,"
Silver said. "At first, sometimes, it's 'You're going to want me to clear-cut my
property!' And when we're done, it's 'Wow, this looks really great, and I like
how livable it is.'"

 Silver stressed that because participation in the program is completely
optional, "There's no enforcement arm, or anything like that. People who are
signing up are doing so because they have concerns and, rightfully so, about
living in the wildland-urban interface, and living with fire and wanting to make
their home as resilient as possible."

 Money for county Parks and Open space, too



 Webster said that about 450 assessments were conducted in 2014, with about
another 200 so far this year. Of those 650, about 125 have been certified as
having completed mitigation.

 "Our biggest barrier (to more certification) right now is time," he said.
"People need more time, and so we have extended people's deadlines to give them
more time to complete their mitigation requirements."

 In addition to the FEMA grant to Wildfire Partners,  Boulder County Parks and
Open Space announced it has received a $600,000 FEMA hazard mitigation grant for
fuels-reduction work at the Betasso Preserve open space area and another
$300,000 for creating defensible spaces for mitigation of potential wildfires
around old houses, barns, sheds and other primarily historic structures at
various open space locations.

 Parks and Open Space also received another $300,000 from the Wildfire Risk
Reduction Grant program of  the Department of Natural Resources.

Editorial: California ratepayers should not pay PG&Es Wine Country wildfires
bill

BYLINE: Mercury News Editorial Board

LENGTH: 599 words



HIGHLIGHT: PG&E wants to make it easier for the company to charge ratepayers --
rather than shareholders -- when its power lines and other electrical equipment
cause wildfires.


PG&E never learns.

The Wine Country wildfires have yet to be fully contained, but the utility
already knows who it believes should accept responsibility for the estimated $1
billion in damages: ratepayers. Even if CalFire investigators determine it was
PG&Es negligence that caused the blazes that killed 42 people and destroyed
8,700 homes and buildings.

PG&E wants ratepayers to pay California wildfire costs

Editorial: PG&E records show utility cannot be trusted

PG&E violated safety rules, was late on thousands of Wine Country electricity
inspections and work orders

PG&E helped stall effort to map risky power lines prone to wildfires

Full recovery from California wildfires may take years

Mercury News editorial: Wildfires are disasters; budget accordingly      What
did you expect?

The Bay Area News Groups Paul Rogers reported Sunday that top PG&E executives
met as recently as last week to lobby officials at the California Public
Utilities Commission to make it easier for the company to charge ratepayers
rather than shareholders  when its power lines and other electrical equipment
cause wildfires.

CalFire investigators have not determined what caused the wildfires. But the
notion that ratepayers should bear the burden for any PG&E incompetence is
unconscionable. If current law isnt clear enough on that issue  and there is
plenty of evidence to suggest it isnt  the Legislature should step in.

A key factor is PG&Es acknowledgment that it has only $800 million in insurance
to cover any damages from the wildfires.

It wasnt ratepayers who decided that issue. Nor was it ratepayers who decided
where and how their money should be spent on maintaining the utilitys power
equipment.

No one wants to see PG&E go bankrupt. The utility also has a fiduciary
responsibility to protect shareholders. But just as shareholders benefit from
the annual $1 billion in profits PG&E rakes in, they should also absorb primary
responsibility for PG&Es shortcomings as the risk they take when they invest in
the utility. If PG&E can just turn to ratepayers to foot the bill, there is less
incentive to buy the necessary insurance or do the necessary maintenance.

Under California law, PG&Es shareholders were given a guaranteed 11.35 percent
profit on any investment in system upgrades. The PUC gave PG&E the highest rate
of return in the nation following the utilitys bankruptcy in 2001 as an
inducement for investors to buy shares in PG&E.

At the same time, PG&E ratepayers pay some of the highest rates in the nation to
maintain what is in concept a high quality system. But the Bay Area News Group
reported last week that PG&E had failed in thousands of instances from 2010-2015
to conduct timely inspections and work orders required by the PUC in Sonoma and
Napa counties, where the Wine Country fires burned.

The latest PG&E outrage is business as usual. The utility has repeatedly tried
to force ratepayers to bear the brunt of its $1.6 billion fine resulting from
its criminal conviction for causing the 2010 San Bruno gas pipeline tragedy. It
has done this despite having taken $150 million of ratepayer money that was
intended for gas pipeline repairs and instead spent it on an executive salaries
and bonuses.

You cant put a corporation in jail. The only way to force accountability is to
penalize shareholders. Theyll demand change when their return on investment
drops.

And if that doesnt work, its time to look at dismantling the utility and
starting over with a plan to provide power to Northern California.

Only you can prevent forest fires

BYLINE: Joseph Quigley, Postmedia Network

SECTION: OPINION; Pg. A7

LENGTH: 490  words


The awe at the devastation and chaos of forest fires needs to match the awe at
the foolishness of the people that cause them.

The Fort McMurray forest fire is a prominent example of the need for this. This
month, people are reflecting on the destruction of the blaze and how much work
still needs to be done in its wake. But the precise cause of the fire is still
unknown, other than the likelihood it was the result of human activity.

This, and the thousands of human-made wildfires that will spring up over this
year in Alberta, costing us millions, are a constant reminder of human
ignorance. The damage they cause stresses the ongoing need to make that
ignorance a focal point in addressing wildfires.

In 2015, the most recent year in which data is available, 57 per cent of
wildfires in Alberta were man-made according to Alberta Wildfire. That
percentage has remained fairly steady for the past decade, with humans remaining
the majority cause for wildfires within the province and beyond.

It is startling that this remains such a persistent problem, despite the yearly
damage of wildfires.

Although many such human-caused wildfires are small and dealt with quickly,
doing less damage overall than lightning-caused fires, there is an ever-present
risk for these to spread and cause significant damage, which the entire country
bared witness to in Fort McMurray. That human-caused incidents of wildfire can
be prevented by fairly simple fire-management methods makes their continued
presence all the more incredible.

The risk of significant damage makes tackling man-made wildfires at the source a
worthwhile effort, a step government has been willing to take. The Government of
Alberta recently stepped up penalties on people engaging in behaviour leading to
wildfires in an effort to try to curtail this. Locally-based programs such as
FireSmart also go a long way in combating the ignorance that leads to wildfires.

But human-made wildfires continue despite the efforts of government officials.
Years of advocacy efforts and government programs can only go so far to this
problem, when all it takes is one individual or thoughtless action to cause
disaster ?he entire populace needs to band together to prevent human-made forest
fires. As a nation, we had an incredibly compassionate response to the tragedy
of Fort McMurray and united to help those in need. Alberta rightfully celebrated
the power of that unity. It should be comparatively simple for us to unite in a
commitment to doing everything we can to prevent something like this fire from
ever happening again.

Do your part to prevent the fanning of flames.

Keep control of recreational fires and follow fire bans. Listen intently to best
fire safety practices provided to us by our governments and first responders. Be
vigilant and do not take risks by being lethargic in fire safety.

As a wise bear once said, "only you can prevent forest fires," and it is the
very least you could do.

Heinrich Helps New Mexicans Prepare For Wildfire Season

LENGTH: 309  words



Office of the Senator Martin Heinrich, U.S Government has issued the following
news release:

In an effort to help New Mexicans prepare for wildfire season, U.S. Senator
Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) is encouraging residents to visit the Wildfire
Preparedness & Prevention Resource Center on his website, which includes a
Public Service Announcement, as well as active wildfire information, prevention
tips, best practices to protect homes and businesses, and more.

"Wildfire season is here, which means it's more important than ever for each of
us to do our part to protect our communities from unintended fires," said Sen.
Heinrich. "Learning about wildfire danger and being prepared can help reduce the
threat of fires to our natural surroundings, our homes, and our businesses. I
encourage all New Mexicans to visit my website for tips to help you and your
family prepare for wildfire season."

Senator Heinrich, a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural
Resources, is a leading advocate for wildfire funding reform and wildfire
prevention programs in New Mexico, including hazardous fuel reduction,
stewardship contracting, and watershed restoration. He is a cosponsor of S. 326,
the Stewardship End Result Contracting Improvement Act, a bill to reduce the
risk of catastrophic wildfire. The bill would make it easier for federal land
managers and businesses to partner on long-term, large-scale forest treatment.
In addition, he is also a cosponsor of S.235, the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act
of 2015, which would treat the largest fires--roughly 1 percent of annual
fires--as natural disasters, and fund firefighting efforts from a disaster
account similar to the one that funds hurricane and other natural disaster
relief efforts.

New wildfire plan for Blaenavon

BYLINE: Hayley Mills

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 385 words


A NEW wildfire plan has been launched to benefit the Blorenge valley and to help
fire crews attend incidents more quickly.

South Wales Fire and Rescue Service (SWFRS) in partnership with the Blaenavon
Partnership, Forgotten Landscapes Scheme, Torfaen council and Gwent Police has
developed the Blaenavon Region Wildfire plan as part of its community initiative
to reduce wildfires in the area.

It also engages landowners, commoners and the wider community on the impact and
economical cost of wildfires.

The plan was launched at the Blaenavon World Heritage Centre on Thursday.

It will be placed in the cabs of SWFRS appliances based in Cwmbran, Blaenavon
and Ebbw Vale stations and includes Ordance Survey map grids, which highlight
fire breaks and related gates.

Details also include the size of vehicle that will be permitted through the
gates, ensuring that the firefighter crews can safely navigate the Blorenge when
tackling wildfire incidents.

The Head of Operations for South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, Dewi Rose, said:
"The economic cost of wildfires is an enormous burden on communities, including
the direct costs associated with firefighting and securing wildfires, as well as
the loss of income for farming and forestry activities.

"We have been working with our partner organisations to produce the wildfire
plan for the Blaenavon region in the hope that this will secure the future of
such an outstanding and beautiful area of Wales."

Wildfires are most common during March and April, with SWFRS working with
communities to raise awareness and reduce risk.

The Forgotten Landscape Partnership commons officer, Alvin Nicholas, said: "
Wildfires are threats that need to be addressed. This partnership will allow the
emergency services, the Blaenavon Partnership and other stakeholders to
communicate effectively on fire-related issues in and around the Blaenavon World
Heritage Site.

"Our aim is to ensure that this globally important landscape meets the needs of
the present generation whilst being conserved for future generations."

Members of the public can download the SWFRS Fire Crime app - available on both
iPhone and Android smartphones - where they can take pictures of grass fires and
send them to the Ssrvice, as well as reporting fly tipping.

Cal Fire app delivers wildfire alerts, tips

SECTION: A,A; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 469 words

ABSTRACT

Cal Fire helps track critical fire information plus offers prevention, safety
and evacuation tips. Dubbed "Ready for Wildfire," the app is free and available
for both Android and iOS phones.

FULL TEXT

As you watched the brute destructive power of the Canyon fire 2 - not to mention
countless others - and if you live anywhere near the region's bountiful brush
you probably thought: What if that was my neighborhood?

I stumbled on a new smartphone app from the state's wildfire fighters. Cal Fire
helps track critical fire information plus offers prevention, safety and
evacuation tips.

Dubbed "Ready for Wildfire," the app is free and available for both Android and
iOS phones.

Let me be honest. I've barely had it on my phone for a day. But unlike many an
app of all sorts I've test driven, I'm already impressed.

For starters, it lets the user set up alerts - notifications come via text
message or push alert - of nearby wildfires tracked by Cal Fire, both from set
locations (such as home or a county) or roam with you (if you are camping or
hiking). The app sent out an alert about Canyon fire 2 at 12:05 p.m. Oct. 9.

The app also helps a user do a deeper dive into the wildfire scene with lists
and maps of wildfires being fought across California.

That includes fairly useful information and data on each wildfire plus links to
deeper information. It can be frustrating to keep up with these kinds of
emergency situations when numerous public-safety agencies are involved.

And while this app doesn't cure that challenge, is a worthwhile tool.

Please note, this is primarily the state's official information - not real-time
news coverage - but it's stuff that can be very helpful. And it gives you easy
access to Cal Fire's own wildfire news feed.

But what's most impressive to me are three guides for anyone who lives anywhere
near wild brush.

Like me!

It tells you the basics for prepping a property and household for wildfire
season, and what a family should do when a wildfire strikes or evacuation orders
are issued. And a "preparedness meter" can monitor your progress - that means
"nudge" - on completing Cal Fire's suggested wildfire tips.

Oh, sure, you can find this kind of primer in many places. But there could be a
literal lifesaver within this app: Tips on what do when you're stuck in a
wildfire situation.

I will admit I did not know how to prepare a house as you evacuate to minimize
it catching fire. And I was captivated to read what do if it's a worst-case
scenario and you're trapped by the blaze - in the home, car or outside.

It's a good bet you'll be near your phone in such a situation, and Cal Fire's
advice could save your life or the lives of loved ones. If you have the presence
of mind to click on this app, following step-by-step commands could up your
survival chances.

Not bad, for free.

Washington: Bera, Simpson, Kilmer, Reichert, Schrader Lead 54 Representatives
Calling for Wildfires to be Treated Like Natural Disasters

LENGTH: 1091 words



 Washington: Office of the MP Ami Bera has issued the following news release:



 Representatives Ami Bera, M.D. (CA-7), Mike Simpson (ID-2), Derek Kilmer
(WA-6), David Reichert (WA-8), and Kurt Schrader (OR-5) led a group of 54 other
representatives in calling for an immediate fix to the practice of "fire
borrowing," which forces federal land agencies to take money from other
important projects to cover the costs of dealing with wildfires. Many of these
projects are used to prevent wildfires from spreading out of control. The
Western United States is still experiencing dry conditions that have stoked
wildfires for several weeks, with conditions primed for more to come. Last year,
fires swept over 10 million acres and damaged communities and wildlife.
Following the letter, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources
pushed for an end to fire borrowing.





 "The practice of fire borrowing is irresponsible - our first responders must
have the resources they need to combat wildfires," said Bera. "My home state of
California has seen the terrible damage wildfires can do to homes, ecosystems,
and entire communities - the same devastation that other natural disasters
incur. We need to start treating wildfires like every other natural disaster
that has access to emergency funding."



 "The severity of recent fire seasons underscores the fact that our current
wildfire suppression budget does not work," said Simpson. "The Forest Service
budget for wildfire suppression was roughly 15% twenty years ago, now it is over
half. Until we address the problem of fire borrowing, funds intended for forest
management, including hazardous fuels removal, timber harvest, and trail
maintenance, will continue to pay for fire suppression."



 "Increasingly intense wildfires are swallowing up the U.S. Forest Service's
budget," said Kilmer. "The practice of fire borrowing cannibalizes funding from
other important areas of the Forest Service like managing our forests. In the
end that hurts forest health, hurts our ability to prevent fires, and hurts
local economies. To reverse this trend the Senate needs to join the House in
finally declaring that wildfires are a natural disaster and should be treated
just like a flood or a hurricane."



 "Last year's relentless wildfires burned over one million acres in my home
state of Washington, destroying homes that stood in their path and displacing
families throughout our region," said Reichert. "And while our brave first
responders worked tirelessly to protect our communities, their efforts were
limited by the resources available to them. This dangerous and irresponsible
cycle of fire-borrowing must end. In order to prevent future wildfires, we must
focus on addressing the issues that cause them in the first place."



 "Wildfire season last year devastated communities throughout Oregon and many
states across the west, shattering spending records and forcing the Forest
Service to divert more money to fighting fires from other programs designated
for hazardous fuels reduction," Schrader said. "When we have catastrophic
wildfires in the west, these are our natural disasters just like the tornadoes
and hurricanes that affect our friends in other parts of the country. It's time
that Congress recognizes this, and acts not only to address the funding issue,
but also the root problem and that's the mismanagement of our forests."

 Washington, DC 20515



 Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Reid, Chairwoman Murkowski and
Ranking Member Cantwell,



 Many Members of Congress are concerned about the costly practice of fire
borrowing.  As we continue to work with our colleagues in the House of
Representatives to end this practice, we would like to urge the Senate to take
up similar legislation.



 As you know, most of the American West is still experiencing severe drought
conditions which has significantly increased the danger for damaging wildfires.
These wildfires cause serious damage to property and threaten lives. In 2015,
more than 10 million acres were burned by wildfires. Federal land agencies
borrowed nearly $700 million from land management and other important activities
to fight these fires. This leaves these agencies with fewer resources to conduct
thinning, timber harvests, and controlled burns which can reduce the severity of
these wildfires.



 Before the 2016 fire season begins, we believe it is critical that Congress
change the way in which we provide funds to the U.S. Forest Service and
Department of Interior to fight catastrophic wildland fires. In seven of the
past 10 years, the costs of fighting wildfires has exceeded the Forest Service's
firefighting budget. This forced the agency to borrow funds intended for forest
management practices.



 In addition, the portion of firefighting costs out of the U.S. Forest Service
budget has risen steadily over the past 20 years.  In 2015, wildland fire
suppression costs were more than 50 percent of the Forest Service's total
budget. Redirecting funds to firefighting takes funds away from other important
programs that can help land managers more actively manage forests to reduce the
risk of future wildland fires.



 We believe that Congress needs to address this problem through legislation that
would treat wildfires like other natural disasters such as floods and
hurricanes. This change would eliminate the need for the Forest Service to use
funds appropriated for other programs to cover the costs of fighting wildfires.



 The House has shown strong support to end fire-borrowing and we are committed
to addressing this problem during the remaining months of the 114th Congress. We
hope that you will do the same and take action to give the Forest Service and
the Department of the Interior the ability to fight wildland fires without
limiting their ability to carry out the rest of their missions. We stand to
ready to work with you to fix this critical problem.

Dropped cigarette may have sparked wildfire on hillside

BYLINE: Jamie Mckenzie

SECTION: NEWS; OTHER; Others; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 407 words


A wildfire which broke out on the hillside above Inverness could have been
started by people out enjoying the weekend wea-ther.

Dozens of firefighters continued fighting the blaze yesterday in an area of land
between Torbreck and Essich, to the south of the city, more than 24 hours after
it started.

At its height, the wildfire affected an area of about 2.5sq km. Fire crews
managed to deal with most of it despite a number of smaller flare-ups yesterday
due to high winds.

John MacDonald, local senior officer for the Highland area, advised the public
to enjoy the summer weather but do so "safely and responsibly to avoid the risk
of wildfires".

He said: "The public can help prevent wildfires by making sure they dispose of
litter and smoking materials carefully and avoid the use of open fires while in
rural areas.

"It's crucial people act safely and responsibly in rural environments and follow
the countryside code."

A fire service spokes-woman confirmed that this was a general piece of public
advice - but could not rule out that the presence of smoking materials may have
caused the wildfire.

An investigation is expected to take place in the coming days to establish the
cause.

A total of six appliances were mobilised after the initial call-out to the
wildfire at about 5.10pm on Sunday.

Crews used beaters, knapsacks and high-powered water jets to douse the flames.

No properties were evacuated but, at one point, the flames completely surrounded
a pylon, with electrical engineers on standby in case it collapsed.

It is the third wildfire in the local area in as many weeks, with a large
wildfire last Friday coming perilously close to homes on the Black Isle with
dozens of firefighters battling into the night to keep it at bay.

The B861 Inverness to Balnafoich road was also closed for several hours due to
the wildfire and motorists were diverted via the B851 road to the A9 at Daviot.

Mr MacDonald added: "I'd like to praise the commitment and determination of our
crews when faced with this significant wildfire as they worked tirelessly and
under arduous conditions.

"As well as our whole-time crews, we are also extremely grateful to our retained
crews who quickly responded and supported firefighting operations which have
continued through the night.

"Their responsive actions highlight just how important our retained firefighters
are - particularly in rural areas - where the risk of wild and grass fires is
rife at this time of year."

Arizona: ADOT supports efforts to fight wildfires

LENGTH: 401  words



Department of Transportation, The State of Arizona has issued the following
press release:

Among the different agencies and organizations involved in fighting wildfires,
the Arizona Department of Transportation may not come to mind. However, ADOT is
active in helping to prevent wildfires both before and during wildfire season.

During the winter and spring seasons, ADOT crews mow down vegetation along the
highway shoulders. Crews also engage in brush removal, thinning trees and
spraying fire retardant within the ADOT right-of-way in order to prevent a fire
or slow the spread of one.

ADOT also requires fire plans as a part of the construction contract for highway
projects. Fire plans indicate what measures will be taken to prevent a fire
starting in the work zone and what to do if a fire flares up. Employees also
engage in training to work in a way that prevents wildfires.

"Combating the threat of wildfires is a team effort," said Flagstaff District
Engineer Audra Merrick. "We make sure we work in ways to help prevent wildfires
along the highway system."

During a wildfire, ADOT supports firefighting efforts by offering the use of
ADOT maintenance crew water trucks to help supply water to firefighters. ADOT
also manages traffic control along highways affected by wildfires, and notifies
the motorists through overhead and portable message boards. Alerts are also
posted on the Traveler Information System at az511.gov.

ADOT crews also work with the wildfire incident command team to assist it in
meeting its goals.

"We are happy to offer aid to those fighting wildfires," Merrick said. "From
providing water to helping emergency responders get in and around the affected
area, ADOT will offer assistance in any way we can."

After a wildfire has been extinguished, ADOT crews assess any damage done to the
highway as well as adjacent areas. As seen recently in Oak Creek Canyon with the
aftermath of the Slide Fire, crews help curb flooding hazards by staging heavy
equipment such as road graders and repair roadway embankments along burned out
slopes within ADOT's right of way in an effort to restore vegetation.

ADOT crews also place erosion control features such as logs, rock dams and
"wattles" - straw-filled canvas tubes that help keep the soil and debris off
highways - along the right of way in preparation for potential flooding.

Florida: Florida Forest Service Releases New Fire Information App

LENGTH: 383  words




 Tallahassee:  Department of Agricuture And Consumer Service, The State of
Florida has issued the following news release:



   Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam H. Putnam and the Florida Forest
Service today announced the release of "FLBurnTools," a new mobile app to inform
the public about drought, wildfire danger and wildfire activity. Prescribed burn
practitioners can also use the app to plan and submit authorization requests.
The "FLBurnTools" app is now available in both Apple's App Store and on Google
Play.





 "By providing Floridians with better access to the latest wildfire information,
we can help protect people, wildlife and property," said Commissioner of
Agriculture Adam H. Putnam. "Residents can now see real-time conditions in their
area and take the appropriate safety precautions."



 The Florida Forest Service's prescribed fire program is a nationwide leader,
treating more than 2.1 million acres last year and providing approximately
88,000 burn authorizations annually. In addition to administering Florida's
prescribed fire program, the Florida Forest Service responds to wildfires during
Florida's year-round wildfire season. Last year, more than 2,100 wildfires
burned 53,476 acres in Florida.



 The "FLBurnTools" app provides the following tools:



     Drought information

     Interactive fire maps

     Wildfire information

     Burning authorization requests

     Smoke dispersion models

     Spot weather forecasts



 "Wildfire activity is on the rise and wildfire danger is expected to increase
greatly in the coming months," said Jim Karels, Florida State Forester.
"Floridians equipped with the 'FLBurnTools' app can view the locations of nearby
wildfires and see up-to-date drought and wildfire danger information."



 The Florida Forest Service, a division of the Florida Department of Agriculture
and Consumer Services, manages more than 1 million acres of state forests and
provides forest management assistance on more than 17 million acres of private
and community forests. The Florida Forest Service is also responsible for
protecting homes, forestland and natural resources from the devastating effects
of wildfire on more than 26 million acres.

Wildfires on decline across California

ABSTRACT

OCR-L-WILDFIRE-TREND-0913: Despite 2017 being one of the worst fire seasons in
recent memory for California and one of the worst ever for the western US, new
research shows a surprising trend: Over the last 40 years, California has seen a
decline in wildfires. Why is that? Researchers don't know yet but they intend to
find out.Reporter: DTEDFORDLength: 1000 wordsArt: FILE + two line charts showing

FULL TEXT

In a year that is already being called one of the worst ever for wildfires in
the western United States, there is another fact that some might find
remarkable: For nearly 40 years, the number of wildfires in California has been
declining.

California wildfire data reviewed by a USGS research ecologist shows a trend
that many might find hard to believe: Since a peak in 1980, there have been
fewer and fewer wildfires in California. This is true across the entire state,
according to researcher Jon Keeley, who is also a professor at UCLA.

According to his paper, co-authored with Alexandra D. Syphard, we need to
rethink our ideas about the frequency of wildfires.

"The claim commonly made in research papers and the media that fire activity is
increasing throughout the western USA is certainly an over-statement," wrote the
authors.

The trend of fewer, but not smaller fires is apparent in recent years. State
data regarding large wildfires (300 acres or more) from 2000 to 2015 show total
numbers - not fire size - has been in decline, despite a sharp spike in 2008.

So, what's the reason for this decline? Well, they don't know ...

yet.

"Can't say at this point what has changed in the last 100 years that has caused
this decline ... but I am hoping we might find out," Keeley said.

What might be behind a decline in wildfires?

Keeley has just begun to analyze the data and look for a reason, but he expects
to finish that analysis by the end of September. He is also sending his research
to Calfire for review.

Keeley is confident the culprits behind the decline can be narrowed down to two-
prevention or climate - but he is reserving his judgment for now.

"Maybe fire prevention strategies or could be related to climate," Keeley said.
"My guess is they would probably like to think it is increasing efficiency in
fire prevention but it remains to be seen if that is the answer at this point."

Keeley is hoping Calfire might be able to point to some specific prevention
strategies and dates they were implemented to help him suss out if they had a
major impact in wildfire declines.

"We definitely have the education side," Calfire spokesman Scott McLean said.
"We spend a lot of money being proactive in trying to educate the public."

While McLean said the organization has adopted social media and other modern
tactics in recent years to better reach the public about fire prevention,
Calfire's education efforts have been happening for decades.

"There are some embarrassing programs out there with blue leisure suits and
mullets," he said.

McLean said a decline in the amount of wildfires was a win for the agency's
outreach programs since the majority of wildfires are the result of human
causes.

"I love to see the trend of wildfires going down," McLean said. "That means we
are getting the message out."

While the amount of wildfires has gone down, something else has been happening.

Despite the decline in overall fires, the amount of acres burned by wildfires
isn't following the same trend. In fact, acreage burned by wildfires is doing
just the opposite.

"For most ignition sources we have found a decline in the numbers since the
1980s, but not a decline in the area burned," Keeley said.

Large wildfire numbers from 2000 to 2015 illustrate the growth in burned
acreage. While the numbers are volatile year to year, the overall trend shows
growth in fire sizes.

McLean attributes the growth in acres burned to environmental factors that have
made fires burn hotter and faster than in the past. Despite that, he credited
Calfire for its work in keeping the majority of fires from spreading. According
to Calfire data, 95 percent of fires are kept at less than10 acres.

"We are constantly training. We always pay attention to what is going on, we
always investigate," he said. "We investigate what took place and we learn from
it and we make sure our firefighters learn from it."

One reason acreage may be up is from the record winter rains that replenished
fuel for fires by spawning plant growth, including the return of grass that had
disappeared from wildland areas throughout Southern California during the
drought.

Grass fires tend to burn faster and increase the amount of acres burned,
according to a 2008 paper published by UC Merced Sierra Nevada Research
Institute's Anthony Westerling.

Other researchers point to climate change, but Keeley said he thinks there may
be other variables at-play.

"People who have written on it tend to ascribe it to climate change, but I think
we are a long way from knowing if that is what is going on," he said.

2017 trending in the wrong direction

During the last 40 years, there have been a number of years that have bucked the
trend of dwindling wildfire numbers and 2017 is already well on its way to being
one of those outliers.

As of Sept. 11, Calfire has reported 5,102 wildland fires in their jurisdiction
with nearly 230,000 acres burned. During the same time period in 2016, there
were 3,803 wildfires and 204,000 acres burned. The five-year average has been
3,872 wildland fires and 155,807 acres burned, according to Calfire.

2017 is also the most expensive year for wildfires as Montana, Washington and
Oregon, among others, have all been hit by devastating blazes. As a result, U.S.
Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Purdue announced Thursday the cost of fighting
fires has exceeded $2 billion. It has also been a record-setting year for heat
in California and other western states, according to the National Climate Report
produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

While 2017 has been worse than predicted across western states after there were
hopes a wet winter would diminish the fire season, McLean wasn't surprised by
the numbers considering the years of drought and the fuel created by the rain
that preceded fire season.

"As a firefighter, you wake up in the morning 'what's the weather doing' because
that tells you what your day is going to be like," he said.

In a year that is already being called one of the worst ever for wildfires in
the western United States, there is another fact that some might find
remarkable: For nearly 40 years, the number of wildfires in California has been
declining.

California wildfire data reviewed by a USGS research ecologist shows a trend
that many might find hard to believe: Since a peak in 1980, there have been
fewer and fewer wildfires in California. This is true across the entire state,
according to researcher Jon Keeley, who is also a professor at UCLA.

According to his paper, co-authored with Alexandra D. Syphard, we need to
rethink our ideas about the frequency of wildfires.

"The claim commonly made in research papers and the media that fire activity is
increasing throughout the western USA is certainly an over-statement," wrote the
authors.

The trend of fewer, but not smaller fires is apparent in recent years. State
data regarding large wildfires (300 acres or more) from 2000 to 2015 show total
numbers - not fire size - has been in decline, despite a sharp spike in 2008.

So, what's the reason for this decline? Well, they don't know ...

yet.

"Can't say at this point what has changed in the last 100 years that has caused
this decline ... but I am hoping we might find out," Keeley said.

What might be behind a decline in wildfires?

Keeley has just begun to analyze the data and look for a reason, but he expects
to finish that analysis by the end of September. He is also sending his research
to Calfire for review.

Keeley is confident the culprits behind the decline can be narrowed down to two-
prevention or climate - but he is reserving his judgment for now.

"Maybe fire prevention strategies or could be related to climate," Keeley said.
"My guess is they would probably like to think it is increasing efficiency in
fire prevention but it remains to be seen if that is the answer at this point."

Keeley is hoping Calfire might be able to point to some specific prevention
strategies and dates they were implemented to help him suss out if they had a
major impact in wildfire declines.

"We definitely have the education side," Calfire spokesman Scott McLean said.
"We spend a lot of money being proactive in trying to educate the public."

While McLean said the organization has adopted social media and other modern
tactics in recent years to better reach the public about fire prevention,
Calfire's education efforts have been happening for decades.

"There are some embarrassing programs out there with blue leisure suits and
mullets," he said.

McLean said a decline in the amount of wildfires was a win for the agency's
outreach programs since the majority of wildfires are the result of human
causes.

"I love to see the trend of wildfires going down," McLean said. "That means we
are getting the message out."

While the amount of wildfires has gone down, something else has been happening.

Despite the decline in overall fires, the amount of acres burned by wildfires
isn't following the same trend. In fact, acreage burned by wildfires is doing
just the opposite.

"For most ignition sources we have found a decline in the numbers since the
1980s, but not a decline in the area burned," Keeley said.

Large wildfire numbers from 2000 to 2015 illustrate the growth in burned
acreage. While the numbers are volatile year to year, the overall trend shows
growth in fire sizes.

McLean attributes the growth in acres burned to environmental factors that have
made fires burn hotter and faster than in the past. Despite that, he credited
Calfire for its work in keeping the majority of fires from spreading. According
to Calfire data, 95 percent of fires are kept at less than10 acres.

"We are constantly training. We always pay attention to what is going on, we
always investigate," he said. "We investigate what took place and we learn from
it and we make sure our firefighters learn from it."

One reason acreage may be up is from the record winter rains that replenished
fuel for fires by spawning plant growth, including the return of grass that had
disappeared from wildland areas throughout Southern California during the
drought.

Grass fires tend to burn faster and increase the amount of acres burned,
according to a 2008 paper published by UC Merced Sierra Nevada Research
Institute's Anthony Westerling.

Other researchers point to climate change, but Keeley said he thinks there may
be other variables at-play.

"People who have written on it tend to ascribe it to climate change, but I think
we are a long way from knowing if that is what is going on," he said.

2017 trending in the wrong direction

During the last 40 years, there have been a number of years that have bucked the
trend of dwindling wildfire numbers and 2017 is already well on its way to being
one of those outliers.

As of Sept. 11, Calfire has reported 5,102 wildland fires in their jurisdiction
with nearly 230,000 acres burned. During the same time period in 2016, there
were 3,803 wildfires and 204,000 acres burned. The five-year average has been
3,872 wildland fires and 155,807 acres burned, according to Calfire.

2017 is also the most expensive year for wildfires as Montana, Washington and
Oregon, among others, have all been hit by devastating blazes. As a result, U.S.
Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Purdue announced Thursday the cost of fighting
fires has exceeded $2 billion. It has also been a record-setting year for heat
in California and other western states, according to the National Climate Report
produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

While 2017 has been worse than predicted across western states after there were
hopes a wet winter would diminish the fire season, McLean wasn't surprised by
the numbers considering the years of drought and the fuel created by the rain
that preceded fire season.

"As a firefighter, you wake up in the morning 'what's the weather doing' because
that tells you what your day is going to be like," he said.

Help prevent wildfires on the Canada Day long weekend

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 618 words


With the arrival of rising temperatures and drier conditions, wildfire danger
ratings are climbing in many parts of British Columbia .

Members of the public are urged to exercise caution and remain vigilant over the
Canada Day long weekend to help prevent human-caused wildfires.

From April 1 through June 27, 2017, the BC Wildfire Service responded to 237
wildfires in B.C., 165 of which were caused by people. Human-caused fires are
completely preventable and unnecessarily tie up crucial firefighting resources
that could be used to deal with naturally occurring wildfires.

Campfires are currently permitted in most parts of the province, including in
our Coastal fire centre region. Larger Category 2 open fires are prohibited in
the Campbell River region , however, to reduce wildfire risks and protect public
safety.

A poster explaining the different categories of open burning is available
online: www.gov.bc.ca/openfireregs

Local governments might also have their own burning restrictions or bylaws in
place, so always

check with local authorities before lighting any fire of any size.

Campfires (where they're allowed) must not be larger than 0.5 metres high or 0.5
metres wide. Never light a campfire or keep it burning in windy conditions.
Weather can change quickly and wind may carry embers to other combustible
material.

Maintain a fireguard around the campfire. This is a fuel-free area where all
flammable materials (grass, kindling, etc.) have been removed right down to the
soil. Never leave a campfire unattended.

Have a shovel or at least eight litres of water available to properly extinguish
your campfire. Make sure that the ashes are cold to the touch before leaving the
area for any length of time.

Anyone who lights a campfire is legally responsible for making sure it doesn't
escape. That person could be held accountable for damages and fire suppression
costs if his or her negligence results in a wildfire. Anyone found in
contravention of an open burning prohibition may be issued a violation ticket
for $1,150, required to pay an administrative penalty of $10,000 or, if
convicted in court, fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail.

Anyone riding an all-terrain vehicle or dirt bike should have a spark arrestor
installed on the vehicle. Check the condition of the muffler, regularly clear
build-ups of grass or other vegetation from hot spots on the vehicle, stay on
dirt paths and avoid tall grass and weeds to reduce wildfire risks.

Smokers must dispose of cigarette butts and other smoking material responsibly,
making sure that these materials are completely extinguished.

The government's natural resource officers and conservation officers conduct
regular patrols throughout British Columbia, monitoring high-risk activities and
looking out for potential damage. These officers work closely with BC Wildfire
Service staff to investigate the cause of wildfires and any improper use of fire
when an open burning prohibition is in effect.

To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open burning violation, call
1-800-663-5555 tollfree or *5555 on a cellphone. To report suspicious
activities, environmental damage or a natural resource violation, call
1-877-952-RAPP (7277) or *7277 on a cellphone.

The BC Wildfire Service thanks the public for its help in preventing wildfires.

Where theres smoke, theres (potential) wildfire

BYLINE: Kellie Ann Benz

LENGTH: 249 words



HIGHLIGHT: The wildfires might not be in Saratoga or Los Gatos, but according to
experts, the wet winter only made the possibility even greater.


If you think you could smell smoke in Los Gatos and Saratoga air this week, you
would be right. According to Santa Clara County Fire Department Capt. Bill
Murphy, Statewide, were currently already above our historical average for
wildfires.

Considering that wildfire season only just began, that statement rings alarm
bells in seasoned fire vets like Murphy.

He cautioned area residents from assuming theyre out of danger this year.

A common misconception is that our wet winter moistened the ground and wildfires
would be lessened, said Murphy by phone. But what actually happened is the rain
played a big role in increasing the grass crop this year.

Pets and Wildlife: Bay Area adoptions, other events, July 6 and beyond

He added that that is the reason the east foothills are currently experiencing a
wildfire at San Felipe and Metcalf roads, 8 miles northeast of Morgan Hill in
San Jose.

That tends to be where the driest grasses are.

But, Murphy reminded, dont let the distance of this current fire lull you into a
sense of safety.

Fires are moving easily this year, Murphy said. Were in the early part of the
season, you should take these early fires as warning to ensure your propertys
defensible space and have your game plan should you need to get out of the area
fast.

Minnesota: Wildfire Prevention Week raises awareness of outdoor fire hazards

LENGTH: 326  words


Department of Natural Resources, The State of Minnesota has issued the following
press release

Gov. Mark Dayton has declared April 20-26 as Wildfire Prevention Week in
Minnesota to increase awareness of outdoor wildfire hazards.

Each spring wildland firefighters and rural fire department volunteers spend
countless hours battling wildfires that could have been easily prevented.

In the past 18 months, wildfires burned 21 homes and three commercial buildings
and threatened more than 500 other structures, according to the Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources. These fires were caused by people misjudging
the weather and danger of fires escaping their control.

"Due to the dead and dry grasses that can easily catch fire, spring is always a
risky time for wildfires in Minnesota," said Larry Himanga, DNR wildfire
prevention coordinator. "Right now the fire danger in southern and central
Minnesota is high, which means fires can easily start and quickly spread.
Therefore, burning permits are not being issued in most of these areas."

A major cause of wildfires is burning yard waste. The DNR recommends composting
or mulching instead. If burning is necessary, landowners should check fire
burning restrictions in their area, get a burning permit, be careful with their
debris fires and remember small-piled debris can hold hot coals for several days
to months for large ones.

The DNR has developed new wildfire prevention Web pages to help increase
awareness of wildfire prevention and the dangers of wildfires.

Burning restrictions will continue to expand into northern Minnesota as fire
danger increases due to snow melt.

Visit the current statewide fire danger and burning restrictions Web page for
more information.

"When you light a fire, you are responsible for keeping it under control and
staying with it until it is out," Himanga said. "If you think your fire is out,
check again."

Researchers expect chance of wildfires to increase in the future

BYLINE: Marlena Hartz, Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, Texas

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 740 words


Apr. 8--Wildfire patterns across the globe will gradually shift as a result of
climate change, according to researchers at Texas Tech and the University of
California, Berkeley.

If emission patterns don't change, larger and larger swaths of the U.S. will be
more susceptible to fire as time goes on, computer model predictions developed
by the researchers show.

Portions of the western United States, including Nevada, Idaho and Montana, as
well as the western Great Lakes region and outlaying states, will be more
susceptible to wildfire outbreaks from 2010 to 2039, the models show.

The frequency of wildfire outbreaks in Texas will decrease or change little in
those next two decades; but in the following 60 years, the U.S. will grow more
and more prone to wildfires, and the Texas Panhandle will not be immune, the
study predicts.

Along with most of the U.S., it will become more of a fire hot spot, as the
likelihood of wildfires in some regions, such as Central Africa and Northeast
Asia, decreases, the study, published Tuesday in the science journal PLoS ONE,
predicts.

Portions of states near oceans, including southern Texas, will also see
decreases or little changes in the frequency of wildfires in the distant future,
the study predicts.

The researchers based their findings on projected rising temperatures and
changing rainfall patterns associated with global warming.

The study was partially funded by The Nature Conservancy as part of its effort
to consider wildfire effects when developing conservation plans. It is the first
of its scope, said Katharine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist at Tech who
participated in the study.

"For first time, we've identified factors that can tell us where we expect
wildfire to be around the world. Before, studies focused on regional factors
only," she said.

Wildfires are fueled by lots of vegetation and hot, dry and windy conditions,
Hayhoe said. The portions of the U.S. that the study predicts will become more
prone to wildfires will see less and less rain as a result of global warming,
something that is already happening in mountainous areas of the western U.S.,
she said.

"What we've been seeing is more precipitation in the mountains has been falling
as rain and by the end of winter there is less snow on the ground," she said.

Conservationists and state agencies can use this research as a way to create
forward-looking policies and practices to combat the potentially devastating
consequences of fire, Hayhoe said. Wildfires destroyed nearly 2,000 structures
across the state in little more than two years, from 2007 to present, according
to the Texas Forest Service.

But fire can be beneficial, too. Some trees rely on it to regenerate, so any
changes in a fire regime can dramatically alter the landscape over time, said
the study's lead investigator Meg Krawchuk, a postdoctoral fellow from the
University of California, Berkeley.

The study underscores the need for smart land management practices, said Jim
Bergan, a Tech alumnus and The Nature Conservancy's director of science and
stewardship in Texas. Bergan sees prescribed fires -- intentionally set blazes
managed by people trained in the practice -- as an integral way to lessen the
devastating impacts of wildfires.

"The old adage is true: you can fight fire with fire. ... We would love to see
more landowners embrace fires... if they are well trained and certified," Bergan
said.

Prescribed fires can reduce wildfires' fuel -- acres of dry, overgrown
vegetation -- and regenerate landscapes, he said.

"You reduce the probability (of) catastrophic fires that could come through a
lighting strike or someone throwing a cigarette butt out the window," Bergan
said.

About 90 percent of fires in Texas are caused by humans, said Misty Wilburn with
the Texas Forest Service.

Wildfires: Severity of wildfire threat in question but experts say rain needed

BYLINE: Adam D. Young, Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, Texas

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 1122 words


Jan. 26--Wildfire season is here and one of the few things experts can agree on
in forecasting the extent of this year's threat: Lots of rain or snow soon would
help.

With the devastating 2005-06 wildfire season that scorched more than 3.5 million
acres in more than 10,000 separate fires in West and North Texas still singed in
many minds, forecasting this year's wildfire season seems critical.

Despite the lack of rain and the countless fires across the South Plains so far
this season, like the one that scorched between 10 and 12 acres north of the
Slaton Municipal Airport Sunday and another that burned between 60 and 80 acres
in East Lubbock Jan. 2, Sandra Rideout-Hanzak, an assistant professor and
researcher at Texas Tech's Fire Ecology Center, said such wildfires are not
indicative of a repeat of 2006.

Instead, she said, this winter's fires are an expected, natural product of
wildfire season. "We're much better off than this time in 2006," she said
crediting the Sept. 11 rainfall and fewer extremely windy days reducing the
wildfire threat. "I don't believe we're at the level of danger."

Most areas on the South Plains have had no significant precipitation since Sept.
11 when 8 inches of rain or more fell on much of the region in one day.

Todd Lindley, meteorologist with the National Weather

Service in Lubbock, said he also anticipates a "typical seasonal fire threat."

For an atypical fire season like 2005-06, he described the needed factors as
high winds, warmer than usual temperatures, dry conditions and unseasonable
curing of vegetation.

"So far this year, we've lacked the drought part of it," Lindley said, also
noting that area vegetation is dry, but due to the Sept. 11 rains, not
unseasonably so.

Wildfire seasons tend to coordinate more with the El Nino weather pattern, he
said, as was the case in 2006. This season, Pacific warming trends are between
El Nino and La Nina weather patterns.

But temperatures in the South Plains are expected to border on the high end of
average and precipitation on the lower end during the next three months.

Average high temperatures in Lubbock for February, March and April are 58, 66.2
and 74.7 degrees respectively. Average precipitation in Lubbock for those months
is 0.71, 0.76 and 1.29 inches respectively.

Despite the differences between the 2005-06 fire season, first responders such
as Raymond Weber, chief deputy with the Cochran County Fire Department, still
are concerned with the threat posed by current conditions.

"When the wind kicks up, we're going to have fire," he said. "The potential is
there for a repeat of that if we don't have more rain."

With drier winter conditions and months of low relative humidity, areas like
Cochran County, with an "enormous amount of pasture land and more cows than
people," are a potential tinder box, Weber said.

And when it comes to predicting a wildfire season in the South Plains, Texas
Forest Service firefighters often look west.

"If California's burning, Texas does also," said Shane Brown, regional fire
coordinator with the Texas Forest Service in Canyon whose territory covers the
Panhandle south to Big Spring.

Brown said firefighters watch California because they are on the front line of
Pacific warming trends that can create the conditions -- high winds and
temperatures and low humidity among them -- needed for an active wildfire
season.

In November and December, California wildfires burned hundreds of homes and
hundreds of thousands of acres in the southern part of the state, taxing the
state's firefighting resources.

Assuming the hot connection between the two states to be true, looking at the
California fire season could alarm Texas firefighters.

"We've got basically the same fuel conditions," Brown said. "It's just as dry as
it was in '06. If we don't get some dramatic precipitation, we're going to have
a fire season similar to '06."

Despite the states' similarities, Rideout-Hanzak said she believes factors exist
that contrast Texas and California and make this year different from previous
wildfire seasons.

"California and Texas are as different as night and day," she said.

Rideout-Hanzak said she understands the need for firefighting agencies to raise
public awareness about wildfire season, but believes they "don't need to scare
people.

"We get ourselves so worked up about wildfires and we see these terrible images
from the media," she said, "that we forget that we can use fire under more
controlled conditions."

Rideout-Hanzak said she gets frustrated when judges and county commissioners
enact burn bans in periods that are "ideal times to burn a prescribed burn."

Lubbock, Crosby, Garza, Hale, Hockley and Lynn counties currently are not under
burn bans. Floyd, Lamb and Terry counties are.

Prescribed burns, Rideout-Hanzak said, can encourage more plant growth and
remove fuel from potential uncontrollable wildfires.

The method of prescribed she described involves burning a safe perimeter between
100 feet and 500 feet wide around a property and creating a head fire to burn
the interior.

Texas Tech offers a course in prescribed burning through the Department of
Natural Resources Management where students learn about and participate in
prescribed burning.

The class is active this spring but was not offered for the spring of 2006 in
anticipation of the particularly active wildfire season, a fact she said was
indicative of their belief that this wildfire season will not be as severe as
'06.

Regardless, Rideout-Hanzak said prescribed burning is used exclusively when
weather conditions are safe.

But the National Weather Service in Lubbock is not forecasting a break from the
unseasonably warm and dry conditions in the South Plains for the next three
months and warns area residents to be cautious in their outdoor activities until
conditions become safer.

"The key over the next few months is how much precipitation we get," Lindley
said.

Budget deal includes wildfire disaster fund to end borrowing

BYLINE: Matthew Daly; The Associated Press

SECTION: A,A; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 663 words

ABSTRACT

A spending bill approved by the House includes a bipartisan plan to create a
wildfire disaster fund to help combat increasingly severe wildfires that have
devastated the West in recent years

FULL TEXT

WASHINGTON >> A spending bill approved by the House includes a bipartisan plan
to create a wildfire disaster fund to help combat increasingly severe wildfires
that have devastated the West in recent years.

The bill sets aside more than $20 billion over 10 years to allow the Forest
Service and other federal agencies end a practice of raiding non-fire-related
accounts to pay for wildfire costs, which approached $3 billion last year.

The House approved the measure Thursday, with Senate action expected soon after
as Congress faces a Friday night deadline to avoid a partial government
shutdown.

Western lawmakers have long complained that the current funding mechanism - tied
to a 10-year average for wildfires - makes budgeting difficult, even as fires
burn longer and hotter each year.

The new plan sets aside $2 billion per year - outside the regular budget - so
officials don't have to tap money meant for prevention programs to fight
wildfires.

"Common sense has finally prevailed when it comes to how the Forest Service pays
to fight record-breaking forest fires that devastate homes and communities in
Oregon and the West," said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who helped broker the deal
with Sens. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. GOP Reps. Mike
Simpson of Idaho and Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington also played key roles,
along with other lawmakers from both parties.

The Western lawmakers have been fighting for years to end "fire borrowing," a
practice they say devastates rational budgeting for the Forest Service and other
agencies.

"This long-overdue, bipartisan solution to the madness of 'fire borrowing' will
at last treat these infernos like the natural disasters they are, with the
benefit that millions of dollars will now be liberated each year for essential
wildfire prevention," Wyden said in a statement.

The measure establishes a contingency account through 2027, with annual deposits
starting at $2.1 billion and increasing to $2.9 billion. Money from the account
would only be used after funds from usual firefighting accounts are exhausted.





Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, slammed the wildfire measure as a missed opportunity.
The bill "slightly improves the Forest Service's flexibility," but it "does very
little to restore the health of our nation's forests," said Bishop, chairman of
the House Natural Resources Committee.

"Democrats, especially in the Senate, stood in the way of forest reform that
could have prevented future catastrophic wildfires," said Bishop, who supports a
House-passed bill that calls for faster approval of logging projects to reduce
the risk of fire in national forests.

"We are not looking forward to the Schumer fires of 2018," Bishop said,
referring to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, who played a
key role in the spending bill.

Wildfires have burned across dried-out Western forests and grassland in recent
years, causing billions of dollars in damage in California, Oregon and other
states. The Forest Service and Interior Department spent more than $2.7 billion
last year fighting fires - the most expensive wildfire season on record.

The budget deal includes $100 million for fire prevention projects and
recreation programs and enables utilities to work with the Forest Service to
prevent trees from touching power lines and starting wildfires.

Simpson, a senior member of the House appropriations panel, called the wildfire
fund one of his most significant accomplishments in nearly two decades in
Congress.

"It is long past due that wildfires in the West receive equal treatment with
other natural disasters, and this bill delivers the necessary budget changes to
stop the dangerous practice of fire borrowing that has led to catastrophic
wildfires in Idaho and throughout the West," he said.

B.C. nearing worst wildfire season

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. A4

LENGTH: 409 words

DATELINE: KAMLOOPS


British Columbia is poised to face its worst wildfire season as flames scorch
thousands of hectares of land and costs rise to deal with the devastation.

BC Wildfire Service spokesman Kevin Skrepnek said an estimated 8,450 square
kilometres of forest, brush and grassland has been burned since the start of the
wildfire season on April 1.

That compares with a record loss of 8,550 square kilometres in 1958.

"(It's) safe to say we are on track for this to be the worst season on record
for that area burned," Skrepnek said.

He said 154 wildfires are burning across the province and the firefighting price
tag has reached $309 million, though that figure does not include costs for the
loss for 71 homes and 118 outbuildings.

The largest wildfire, in Hanceville, southwest of Williams Lake, now covers
2,120 square kilometres, Skrepnek said.

"We're urging people to be extremely careful with any activity that could spark
a wildfire," he said. "We're continuing to see the increased likelihood of
lightningcaused fires, which makes it even more critical to avoid any
human-caused incidents."

Skrepnek also urged people to report fires.

More than 4,100 people, including about 760 people recruited from outside the
province, are working on firefighting efforts, Skrepnek said.

Chris Duffy, executive director of operations for Emergency Management BC, says
nearly 9,300 people remain out of their homes as 40 evacuation orders are still
in place.

"Our priority remains public safety, first responders'safety and support to
local authorities and First Nations," he said.

He said 31,000 people are on evacuation alert, meaning they must be ready to
leave on a moment's notice.

Evacuation orders in the Cariboo have been downgraded to alerts in some areas,
including Alexis Creek to Riske Creek after residents were forced to leave
Sunday.

However, officials with the Cariboo Regional District said ongoing fire control
activities mean access to some areas may be limited and is at the discretion of
check point personnel.

"We would still urge the public to remain vigilant," Duffy said, adding the fire
risk remains high. "Have an emergency plan, an emergency kit, report fires and
in particular, respect orders and alerts and instructions from first responders,
fire crews, highways (officials) and RCMP who are working around these fire
sites."

Many returning residents have had to power wash off red fire retardant that
covered their property in efforts to protect structures.

Funding for wildfire protection quadrupled

BYLINE: Stuart Thomson, Calgary Herald

SECTION: CITY; Pg. A5

LENGTH: 274 words



As the province gears up for another wildfire season, Agriculture Minister Oneil
Carlier announced a big boost Thursday to funding that helps Alberta communities
protect themselves against wildfires.

The province will provide $15 million a year for the FireSmart program, up from
$3.8 million last year. The government is making a three-year commitment of $45
million, which includes $10.5 million specifically for the Fort McMurray area,
which is still recovering from last year's massive wildfire, a blaze that
destroyed homes, dragged the economy down and caused emotional trauma in
firefighters and residents.

FireSmart is a Canada-wide program that helps communities reduce the risk of
wildfire and plan for the worst-case scenario.

The funds will go to wildfire education, vegetation management and emergency
planning, among other things. Carlier said the program is just "one tool in the
tool box" in a news release.

"The past few years have shown us that we need to do everything we can to help
reduce the risk of wildfire," he said.

With 70 per cent of the wildfires in the province started by human activity,
prevention is a major focus of the government's wildfire strategy. The Fort
McMurray fire is still fresh in people's minds and Carlier said in an interview
Monday he hopes it will encourage people to be more careful this year.

Carlier made the announcement at the Alberta Agriculture and Forestry wildfire
warehouse and air tanker base at Fort McMurray International Airport, before
embarking on a tour of the facility. sxthomson@postmedia.com

Red Cross outreach worker headed to B.C. to help wildfire evacuees; Mother of
three will aid at shelters, supervise Emergency Response Team

BYLINE: Jennifer Ackerman, The Leader-Post

SECTION: CITY; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 501 words


After working closely with the Red Cross during the 2015 Fort McMurray wildfire
response, Georgiana Schuring was inspired to hang up her government hat and put
on the Red Cross vest.

Now she works as outreach coordinator in disaster management for the Red
Cross'southwest Saskatchewan region and was chosen to go to B.C. to help deal
with the thousands of wildfire evacuees in the province.

Schuring will work as an Emergency Response Team supervisor in evacuation
shelters in Kamloops where she will assist ERT responders.

"They're our frontline people and they will be interacting with the evacuees to
make sure their needs are met and identifying any issues that evacuees might
have that we can address," said Schuring.

Schuring's past experience with wildfire response is what led to her passion for
this kind of work. Having worked in emergency social services through the
Saskatchewan Ministry of Social Services, she was part of wildfire responses in
Regina and Cold Lake, but was particularly taken with the volunteer presence in
Calgary for the Fort McMurray wildfire.

"It was a massive response and it was incredible how all the volunteers stepped
up," said Schuring. She commended volunteers who leave their families for weeks
at a time, often multiple times, to help those in need and recalled how the
evacuees, despite fearing for their homes, friends and families, stayed strong.

"They were in a very challenging situation, very similar to the evacuees that we
are seeing today in B.C. People are very resilient and it's something that's
very inspiring," said Schuring.

Schuring will spend two weeks in B.C. A mother herself, Schuring leaves three
children in Regina while she works in Kamloops. She said her children have a
good understanding of her job and are proud of what the Red Cross does so they
are very supportive of her.

She hopes the wildfires are under control by the end of her time there, but said
if the need remains after her two-week stint, she would be more than happy to go
back. She said between the highly qualified emergency management officers and a
thorough understanding of her own job, she isn't afraid for her safety during
her time in B.C.

"They're going to look after us," said Schuring.

Steve Roberts, executive director of the environment ministry's wildfire
management branch, said Saskatchewan's wildfire risk remains low to moderate and
there are currently no active wildfires.

The Saskatchewan government announced it will send more aid to B.C. on Thursday,
including 20 more firefighters and four more wildfire specialist personnel.

That will bring the province's total contribution to a total of 40 firefighters,
one wildfire investigator, two liaison officers, 19 wildfire specialist
personnel, three aircraft and nine support staff for the aircraft group.

Schuring was to leave Wednesday and urged those who wish to help in some way to
go to www.redcross.ca or call 1-800-418-1111. jackerman@postmedia.com

Hell and high water: Northern California is besieged again

BYLINE:  By DON THOMPSON Associated Press

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A6

LENGTH: 385 words


OROVILLE, Calif. - Five months ago, it was fears over flooding. Now it's flames.

When Chuck Wilsey was ordered to flee over the weekend as a wildfire roared near
his ranch home in Oroville, he was ready. He started keeping his truck and
camper loaded with supplies back in February, when some of the heaviest winter
rains on record in California nearly led to catastrophic flooding below the
nation's tallest dam.

"Fire and flood so close together," he marveled on Monday at a Red Cross
shelter. "We just try to stay prepared."

Wilsey, 53, and his family were among about 4,000 people evacuated as flames
raced through foothills in the Sierra Nevada, about 60 miles north of
Sacramento. Sheriff's deputies drove through areas announcing evacuation orders
over loudspeakers.

Crews were making progress against that fire and dozens of others across
California, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico, and into Canada.

Authorities were hopeful some Oroville evacuees would be able to return Monday
as winds diminished and firefighters working in rugged terrain extended
containment lines.

Wilsey said he believed his home was still standing because crews were able to
keep flames from jumping a key road.

His daughter, Krystle Chambers, who lives on the same property, said the one-two
punch of floods and fires was taking a toll.

"It's hard, it's rough," she said. "Way too many hits. First it's this side of
town, then the other side of town. It almost makes you want to move."

The blaze burned nearly 9 square miles of grass, injured four firefighters and
destroyed at least 17 structures. It was 35 percent contained.

The area burning is southeast of Oroville, near where 200,000 residents
downstream from the 770-foot-high Oroville Dam were evacuated in February when
the structure's spillways began crumbling. Wilsey did not have to leave his home
that time.

The fire evacuation zone is just a few miles from the valley areas that were
ordered cleared out during the winter deluge.

Pam Deditch, who runs the shelter where Wilsey and his family were huddled, also
managed a shelter for the flood.

"If it's not one thing, it's the other," she said with a laugh.

The fires broke out amid a blistering weekend heat wave that toppled temperature
records. Slightly cooler weather is expected to give crews a break in the coming
days.

RosslandÃ¢â[#x201a]¬â[#x201e]¢s FireSmart Communities Program holds FireSmart
awareness workshop

SECTION: COMMUNITY

LENGTH: 947 words


Residents in Rossland's Iron Colt neighbourhood are tackling wildfire risk on
their properties to prepare for next year's fire season.

A dozen residents attended a two-hour FireSmart Awareness Workshop offered by
Rossland's FireSmart Communities Program on Saturday, Oct. 21.

The question many of the homeowners wanted answers to was - would Rossland and
specifically their Iron Colt neighbourhood be vulnerable to the wildfire losses
experienced elsewhere in B.C. over the summer of 2017 in the event of a nearby
wildfire?

Residents learned to assess the wildfire hazard to their Iron Colt neighbourhood
homes and reduce that hazard by eliminating ignition opportunities on their
structures and outbuildings and removing or reducing vegetation with a high
ignition hazard where it is located close to homes.

One of the participants summarized, "The workshop was great, we learned in a
couple of hours the basics on how buildings are ignited by wildfire. One of the
big takeaways for us was that even though our homes are relatively FireSmart and
the forest beside our neighbourhood is safely distant from most of the homes -
the embers generated by nearby wildfires can land on our homes and yards, ignite
some of the plantings or objects located close to our homes and those ignitions
can spread to the homes fairly easily. We saw how combustible garden mulch can
ignite cedar hedge plantings or firewood piles beside our homes and quickly
spread to ignite a deck or flare up and break a window allowing flames to enter
the home. Fortunately, we also learned how we can easily mitigate those hazards,
moving back the bark mulch from the combustible decks and replacing juniper and
cedar plantings with less flammable species."

The FireSmart Awareness Workshop is one of several events that the Iron Colt
residents are undertaking in their neighbourhood to reduce wildfire hazard and
become a recognized FireSmart Community under the FireSmart Communities Program.

Earlier this year, a few Iron Colt homeowners - led by Iron Colt resident
Gonzalo Ansede - formed a FireSmart Board and developed a FireSmart Plan under
the provincially funded FireSmart Canada Community Recognition Program. This
FireSmart Plan focuses resident efforts to reduce fire hazard on their
individual properties.

Ansede and several other Rossland residents attended a FireSmart Community
Champion workshop in the spring, receiving training in FireSmart basics about
how to reduce wildfire hazard in their areas. Ansede was enthusiastic about the
training.

"There were 'Community Champions' as the program calls us from three Rossland
neighbourhoods; Black Bear and McLeod Avenue East are also participating in the
program. In half a day we learned how to assess and reduce the wildfire hazards
to our homes as well as how to follow the national FireSmart Communities program
to achieve recognition status."

That training was delivered by Don Mortimer, a consultant with FireSmart Canada
and Rossland resident. Mortimer works across Canada and has trained over 700
fire professionals to work as Local FireSmart Representatives with the wildfire
vulnerable neighbourhoods in their respective communities.

Mortimer works with the City of Rossland FireSmart Program and functions as the
Local FireSmart Representative for the three active FireSmart boards in the
Rossland neighbourhoods.

"We're working with priority neighbourhoods on the City perimeter right now but
will add other neighbourhoods where residents express an interest and a wildfire
risk does indeed exist," said Mortimer.

Mortimer is pleased but not surprised with the Rossland response to the
FireSmart Communities Program.

"Rossland has a decade-long involvement with FireSmart initiatives and the City
has had a Community Wildfire Protection Plan since 2007 - everyone has noticed
the steady progress with wildfire hazard reduction by forest thinning on
strategically located City and Crown lands within and around the City."

Mortimer is excited with the FireSmart Communities Program potential to take
those FireSmart hazard mitigations from public land onto private properties.

"This program is run by the residents themselves, taking priority actions on
simple steps to reduce the wildfire hazard on their homes and in their yards -
they work with a fire professional like myself who recommends specific actions
and gets them started. Progressively, by staging annual FireSmart Events like
the FireSmart Awareness Workshop Iron Colt held on Saturday, the neighbourhood
reduces wildfire risk and ultimately achieves national recognition under the
FireSmart Communities Program."

Looking forward, Mortimer sees a strong future for the FireSmart Communities
initiative as wildfires become more frequent and intense in response to the
effects of climate change on forest conditions.

"The summer of 2017 put wildfire front of mind for most people in B.C. -
property owners are increasingly interested in FireSmart mitigations - they're
understanding that wildfires are a natural and necessary occurrence and if
they're going to become more frequent - they want to reduce the hazard to their
properties as much as possible."

Mortimer recommends that homeowners pick up a copy of the FireSmart Homeowners
Manual - a comprehensive booklet on reducing the potential impacts of wildfire
on your home. The booklet was developed by FireSmart Canada and BC Wildfire
Service and is available at Rossland City Hall or can be downloaded online at
http://www.bcwildfire.ca/prevention/docs/homeowner-firesmart.pdf Anyone with
questions or interest in the Rossland FireSmart Communities Program can contact

Wildfire remain a threat

BYLINE: Peter McCrady, Kerrville Daily Times, Texas

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 556 words


Feb. 04--Even with the recent rains, the threat of wildfires continue to remain
a topic of concern among residents and officials.

"I think this year won't be quite as severe (as last year's drought), but until
it gets into a surplus pattern where we're getting rain ... above normal for a
while, it's going to continue to be an issue where we're going to face wildfire
concerns," said Kerrville Daily Times' meteorologist Cary Burgess about future
drought conditions in the Hill Country. "As long as we keep getting intermittent
days of rain, even if it's just a quarter inch or less, anything is going to be
good right now."

In January, the Hill Country received above average rainfall totaling 2.05
inches, according to measurements taken at Knipling-Bushland U.S. Livestock
Insects Laboratory. The average rainfall for January is 1.58 inches.

Burgess was part of a group of speakers, including state representative Harvey
Hilderbran and other officials, who spoke Monday during a wildfire preparedness
seminar hosted by local environmental agencies.

"I think as long as we stay in the drought, the threat of wildfires is with us,"
said Kristy Vandenberg, executive director of the Hill Country Chapter of the
American Red Cross. "I don't think it's going to go away."

For the 2010-11 fire season, the Texas Forest Service reported almost 4 million
acres burned throughout Texas and about 4,000 homes lost.

Patrick Allen, wildland urban interface specialist with the Texas Forest
Service, said there are a number of conditions that have led up to the current
wildfire situation.

"Wildfires have always (had) a natural roll in the forest system," he said.
"It's always been there, but in the last 100 years or so, we've waged a war
against fire. We have a fire, and we put it out, and it's led to a really
massive fuel build-up and, of course, the rain contributes to that."

Natural Resources Coordinator for the Upper Guadalupe River Authority Tara
Bushnoe said even the recent rains haven't replenished the water that has been
lost due to the drought.

"Overall, (stream flow) is below average," she said. "We've gained some better
values the past six to eight weeks with the rain but ... this most recent rain
brought (the river) up to about 78 cubic feet per second, and normal is about

100 cubic feet per second. So we didn't even get up to normal."

With forecasts uncertain as to what this next year will hold for wildfires,
Allen said preparation is the best way to fight wildfires.

"There are a lot of concerned (residents) for the wildfire season, and it looks
like it will be another interesting one," he said. "(Planning) allows you to
know that, when the wildfire occurs, you've done everything you can to mitigate
your losses."

Vandenberg said thinking ahead about things such as medications, glasses and
identification will make a fire situation less hectic.

"We need people to be aware and think ahead," she said. "The more you've thought
about (what to do in a fire), the more prepared you'll be."

For more information about how to prepare for fires and what to do if a fire is
approaching your home, call the Hill Country Chapter of the American Red Cross
at 257-4677.

Rising temps, shrinking snowpack fuel western wildfires

BYLINE: By Lindsay Harmon

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 863 words


Wildfire trends in the West are clear: there are more large fires burning now
than at any time in the past 40 years and the total area burned each year has
also increased. To explore these trends, Climate Central has developed this
interactive tool to illustrate how warming temperatures and changing spring
snowpack influences fires each year.

To embed this interactive, click the preferred size for the code: 700 x 500 |
500 x 360

In our 2012 report, Western Wildfires, we analyzed federal wildfire data
stretching back to the 1970s to see how fires have changed in the American West.
In some states, like Arizona and Idaho, the number of large fires burning each
year has tripled or even quadrupled. And in other states, including California,
Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and Wyoming, the number of large fires has
doubled.

Over the same span, average spring and summer temperatures across 11 Western
states have increased by more than 1.5cF, contributing to the higher fire risks.
Spring temperatures in Arizona have warmed faster than any other state in the
U.S., rising nearly 1cF per decade since 1970, which has likely played a key
role in Arizona's rapid increase in fires over the past two decades.

In addition, years with abnormally warm spring and summer temperatures tend to
be years with more and bigger fires. For example, 2012 was the hottest spring
and summer on record for Colorado, and the state also saw its second-highest
number of large fires.

The interactive map also includes a preliminary analysis of mountain snowpack
data collected at hundreds of monitoring stations across the West. Not
surprisingly, years with low spring snowpack (measured as the amount of water in
snowpack on the ground as of April 1) also tend to be years with more fires.
When there is a relatively thin snowpack come spring, it can melt quickly as the
weather warms, leaving the forest drier earlier and much more likely to burn.

Across the Southwest in particular, several recent years of below-average spring
snowpack has extended the region's drought and fueled more big fires.

This record of western snowpack data begins in 1980, so it's unclear how well
the blue lines in the interactive represent long-term trends and how much they
have influenced the growth in wildfires. Other research has shown, however, that
there has been a persistent decline in western snowpack since the 1920s. And in
looking at the past 30 years, it's clear that from one year to the next,
below-average snowpack raises the risk of wildfires.

Western wildfires are also influenced by year-to-year climate variability and
how the U.S. Forest Service manages fires, but the trends of rising temperatures
and lesser snowpack hint at what fires will look like in the coming decades.

Researchers predict that the area burned in the West will quadruple for every
additional 1.8cF of temperature rise. According to the draft National Climate
Assessment report, the most recent climate model projections show that
temperatures will rise between 2cF and 4cF across most of the U.S. within the
next few decades, and as much as 8cF by 2100.

Here are a few states that have seen the most dramatic changes in wildfires
since the 1970s:

Nevada

Spring snowpack has been decreasing dramatically in Nevada since the early
1980s. And in 2012, the lowest spring snowpack in more than 30 years, combined
with above-average spring temperatures, helped fuel the biggest wildfire year in
more than a decade.

Idaho

Idaho has seen the biggest increase in wildfires since 1970 than any other
western state. Year-to-year there is still a lot of variability, but in the past
decade, several years with above-average temperatures and low spring snowpack
have led to dozens of large wildfires on federal land.

Colorado

Colorado has the second-fastest warming spring temperatures of any state. And in
2012 - the hottest spring and summer on record for Colorado - the state saw its
second-highest number of large wildfires.

Utah

In the past decade, more wildfires have burned in Utah in most of those years
than any year in the 1970s. And in 2012, thin spring snowpack and above-average
spring temperatures contributed to the biggest wildfire year in a decade.

Arizona

Spring temperatures have warmed faster in Arizona than any other state since
1970. These warming temperatures, matched with decreasing spring snowpack, have
helped increase wildfire risk. Every year since 2004 has seen more fires burn in
Arizona than in any year in the 1970s.

New Mexico

Spring warming in New Mexico is among the top three fastest in the country. In
the past decade, many more wildfires burned in New Mexico than during the 1970s
and 1980s, but the year-to-year variations in wildfires depend on several
factors, including temperatures, spring snowpack, and how large the previous
year's wildfires were.

Wildfire data is based on fires larger than 1,000 acres that burned on U.S.
Forest Service land in the 11 Western states. Temperature data was analyzed
according to the methodology described in The Heat Is On, but for spring and
summer temperatures. Spring snowpack is represented by April 1 snow-water
equivalent measurements collected by the SNOTEL network

Preparing to ward off fire;
North Port community joins national Firewise program

BYLINE: By ERIN BRYCE erin.bryce@heraldtribune.com

SECTION: B SECTION; Pg. BV1

LENGTH: 596 words



Although it's been more than five years since the last wildfire threatened
Woodland Estates, many of the neighborhood's 63 residents remember it.

The community, a private neighborhood just to the northwest of the North Port
city limits, was less than a half a mile away from flames that torched more than
4,500 acres of the Carlton Reserve and crossed into the city's northern border.

"We all stood on the bridge out there and watched the flames," resident Dianne
Latona said. "Everybody was concerned."

Driven by that memory and the active wildfire season last spring, Woodland
Estates residents wanted to do something to reduce the threat of wildfire
engulfing their rural community.

Last week, Woodland Estates became the first neighborhood in Charlotte, DeSoto,
Hardee, Manatee and Sarasota counties to become a Firewise Community.

The national program encourages residents in wildfire-prone areas to reduce
fire-feeding vegetation and build buffers that can help slow down a fire's
advance.

Several other communities in the region are moving in that direction -- a trend
that could make a difference for the increasing number of neighborhoods that
have been chiseled into prime wildfire breeding grounds.

"Just like out in California, they're tired of the city," said Patrick Mahoney,
wildfire mitigation specialist with the state Division of Forestry. "What you
have happening is that people will move out to North Port Estates or Woodland
Estates, to those types of places, to get out of the city."

But those types of neighborhoods -- surrounded by scrubland or slash pine
forests -- are in wildfire habitat. The problem is growing in Florida, where
growth is increasingly pushing into areas where wildfires are a seasonal part of
the natural cycle.

More than 300 wildfires burned more than 4,000 acres in Southwest Florida this
year, making 2006 one of the more active fire seasons the region has seen in
recent years. Statewide, 4,689 wildfires burned 221,192 acres since January,
according to the state Division of Forestry.

The Firewise program was launched in the early 1990s by the National Wildfire
Coordinating Group. It incorporates a variety of safety measures, from removing
pine needles from gutters and dead brush from around homes to building fire
breaks around entire neighborhoods.

The program targets communities like Woodland Estates, which is literally tucked
beneath a dense forest of cabbage palms and pine and oak trees. The goal is to
reach a balance between fire protection and maintaining wildlife and a healthy
tree canopy.

A Girl Scout camp in Manatee County and a community in Charlotte County also
have begun working on the program, which is initiated by property owners.

"This is the perfect example of a neighborhood coming together," said Randy
Coldiron, a firefighter with the Division of Forestry.

Coldiron spent most of this week on a hydraulic tractor, creating winding
walking paths under the dense saw palmettos and cabbage palms in Woodland
Estates. The 10-foot-wide paths function as fire breaks and run around the
perimeter of homes and along fence lines.

Firefighters can use the paths to stretch hoses and work a fire, and the breaks
also reduce the height of flames, making them easier to extinguish.

All of the work is paid for by the Division of Forestry. Sarasota County fire
mitigation specialist Joe Padgett said fire officials will return in eight
months for maintenance.

"We're going to continue to work with these folks," Padgett said. "This is
something that I think is very important to the community. Everybody's working
together."

Support my MLA and wildfire victims

SECTION: OPINION

LENGTH: 493 words


Editor,

This is open letter to Premier John Horgan.

Re: Discrimination against certain wildfire victims & capital gains tax on
burned logged timber.

My MLA [Cariboo-Chilcotin] Donna Barnett has been working for several months now
trying resolve wildfire victim issues, and also trying to get us some financial
assistance, which unfortunately so far hasn't come from our current government.

I would hope other interested British Columbia MLA's would get on board support
her efforts

B.C. wildfire victim's, aren't getting the financial assistance they require
unless the wildfire losses involve permanent residences/property.

Like my wife and I, some property owners are being told they "don't qualify" for
any financial assistance because their losses involve recreational land or
investment property, etc.

I'm sure a number of other B.C. MLA's must have property owners in their
jurisdictions that are also struggling with similar losses as ours who have been
denied any help by the B.C. government, federal government and the Red Cross.

However, if you don't already know about how some wildfire victims are being
treated, please take the time to read my letter and you will get a better
understanding about how some of us will be up against a financial brick wall if
we continue to be refused help by the Wildfire Victims Financial Assistance
Recovery Program.

That title really should be changed if it doesn't include all BC wildfire
victims!

As far as I'm concerned, what our governments are doing is a provincial and
federal disgrace, not to mention unfair, unjust and discriminatory.

The ultimate kick in the guts for some of us is a federal government that wants
us to pay a capital gains tax on burned timber we have no choice but to log off
before the bugs destroy what's left of it.

What this all may be coming down to is for every so-called "unqualified" B.C.
wildfire victim to sign onto a class action suit against the B.C Government and
the BC Wildfire Service.

It is no secret that the vast destruction caused by the 2017 B.C. wildfires was
in large due to mismanagement, inadequate fire guards and back burns that should
not have taken place.

That information has come straight from machine operators and firefighters who
worked on various wildfires in B.C.

I'm sure there would be more than enough of these people that could be summons
to provide their professional opinion regarding where huge mistakes were made
that needlessly caused the destruction of private property.

Any support you can provide wildfire victims that aren't getting the help they
need will no doubt be appreciated, and if you aren't already on board with my
MLA trying to turn some of this mess around, please do so.

I'm perfectly fine with having this e-mail and my letter/s circulated to
everyone and anyone interested including the Canadian media regarding how
certain wildfire victims are being treated by our provincial and federal
governments of the day.

Fire service warning of rural wildfire danger

LENGTH: 408  words


It may feel cold, but the fire service is warning of the danger of wildfires in
rural areas.

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is appealing to everyone in the countryside
to pay close attention to wildfire danger warnings as weather forecasters
predict dry and windy conditions in the coming days.

A high pressure system is dominating the UK's weather and this has historically
been linked to elevated wildfire behaviour at this time of year.

While no specific wildfire warnings are in place, forecasters have advised that
the situation, which has the potential to bring dry continental air to Scotland,
is likely to persist for the coming week.

SFRS Deputy Assistant Chief Officer Andy Coueslant, the chair of the Scottish
Wildfire Forum, said raising awareness is key to reducing the risk.

He explained: "Wildfire conditions have the potential to change markedly from
day-to-day depending on the wind direction and it's all-the-more important
people are vigilant and act responsibly while this period of high pressure
affects the country.

"Many rural and remote communities are hugely impacted by wildfires, which can
cause significant environmental and economic damage.

"Livestock, farmland, wildlife, protected woodland and sites of special
scientific interest can all be devastated by these fires, as can the lives of
people living and working in rural communities.

"Human behaviour can significantly lower the chance of a wildfire starting and
also help us to bring those that do happen under control, so it's crucial people
act safely and responsibly in rural environments and follow the countryside
code."

The public can help prevent wildfires by making sure they dispose of litter and
smoking materials carefully while in rural areas.

There are a number of things land managers can do to help prevent wildfires,
including strict adherence to the Muirburn Code, which applies to the controlled
burning of heather within the permitted season.

Further advice is available on the Your Safety section of the SFRS website,
www.firescotland.gov.uk, where links can be found to both the Muirburn Code and
the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.

Many wildfires are started deliberately or are due to careless, reckless or
irresponsible behaviour.

Anyone who sees someone acting suspiciously, recklessly or irresponsibly in the
countryside should contact Police Scotland on 101 or pass information
anonymously to Scotland Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

County agencies to develop a wildfire protection plan

BYLINE: The Moultrie Observer, Ga.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 437 words


Nov. 10--MOULTRIE -- During late fall and early winter, generally after a frost,
landowners begin burning off fields and woodlands. And even though permits are
required and many landownsers are very experienced in burning, fires do
sometimes get out of hand.

And because our community is becoming much more of a pastoral residential area,
that means homes, barns and other outbuildings become vulnerable to wildfires.

In that regard,  the local office of the Georgia Forestry Commission announced
today that the agency is working with Colquitt County officials and the Colquitt
County Volunteer Firefighter's Association to design a Community Wildfire
Protection Plan (CWPP).

CWPP's are developed by cities and counties as part of a national initiative to
protect residents in rural areas from the threat of a disastrous wildfire.

"More and more people are choosing to live in homes just on the limits of towns
and cities in forested or wildland areas," said Denny Sellers, chief ranger for
the Georgia Forestry Commission. "These areas are known as the wildland/urban
interface and when wildfires occur in these regions, fire protection becomes
much more challenging. A custom CWPP enhances public safety on many fronts."

Also according to Sellers, the Community Wildfire Protection Plan will improve
community sustainability; enhance safety of area residents; protect ecosystem
health; raise awareness of wildfire hazards and wildfire risk; educate
landowners about how to reduce home ignitability; and build and improve
collaboration at multiple levels.

A Community Wildfire Protection Plan favorably supports Colquitt County grant
applications for hazard mitigation funds through the National Fire Plan, FEMA
mitigation grants, and others. Under the Healthy Forest Restoration ACT (HFRA)
of 2003, communities that seek such grants for hazardous fuels reduction work
are required to prepare a CWPP.

"This CWPP will provide an evaluation of Colquitt County's wildland/urban
interface," explained Russell Moody EMA director for the county. "It will be a
valuable guide and action plan to protect homes, property and lives from the
threat of wildfire."

For more information about the CWPP process or to review a copy of the Colquitt
County CWPP, contact Denny Sellers at 229-891-7120.

Crapo, Bennet Secure Provision to Prioritize Wildfire Mitigation Efforts

LENGTH: 492  words



Office of the Senator Mike Crapo, U.S Government has issued the following news
release:

U.S. Senators Mike Crapo (R-Idaho and Michael Bennet (D-Colorado) have secured a
measure in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations Bill to help
prioritize wildfire mitigation efforts.  The bill directs the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) to develop a report detailing its efforts to mitigate
wildfires and identify any funding obstacles for current mitigation programs.

Last week, Bennet and Crapo urged the Subcommittee to push FEMA to use a greater
share of its mitigation funding to prevent catastrophic wildfires.  In the
letter to the subcommittee's chair and ranking member, Bennet and Crapo shared
concerns about inadequate funding and recommended the report as a first step.

Specifically, the Crapo-Bennet measure in the bill says, "Over the last decade,
wildfires have caused an average of over $1,000,000,000 in economic damages,
killed over 150 Americans, and destroyed thousands of homes and other structures
across the Nation. The six worst wildfire seasons in the past 50 years in the
United States have all occurred since 2000. The Committee is concerned that
mitigation efforts are not keeping pace with the growing risk. FEMA is directed
to provide a report to the Committee no later than 120 days after the date of
enactment of this act on the efforts being made to mitigate wildfires including
FEMA technical assistance, information sharing, and grant expenditures for the
last 5 years. FEMA should also identify any funding obstacles for wildfires in
its current mitigation programs."

A 2007 CBO study of FEMA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program found that a
very small share of the agency's funding went to wildfires.  Yet, in the same
report, CBO concluded that for every dollar FEMA has spent through the PDM fund
on wildfire mitigation, it has saved more than $5 in future disaster losses.

"Idahoans know firsthand how devastating fire season can be," Crapo said.  "Last
year, more than 1,000 wild land fires burned more than 1.6 million acres in
Idaho alone and we are already seeing a number of fires this season.  I applaud
the work of the Appropriations Committee and thank them for making wildfire
mitigation a top priority.  This bill will provide FEMA the resources to help
our western states mitigate for the devastating wildfire season even before it
starts."

"Colorado and communities throughout the West are facing increasingly
devastating wildfire seasons. They continue to grow in frequency and intensity,"
Bennet said.  "This bill sends a message to FEMA that wildfire mitigation
programs are a priority and should be expanded in the future.  They've proven to
make a tangible difference and may help us prevent the tragic and unprecedented
loss of life and staggering levels of destruction we have endured over the past
decade."

Protecting Alabama from wildfires is a top priority of Forestry Commission

BYLINE: The Florala News staff

LENGTH: 722  words


October is Wildfire Prevention Month! The USDA Forest Service and the Alabama
Forestry Commission have a long-standing partnership that unites numerous
federal, state and local fire specialists at a moment's notice to protect
Alabama communities and natural resources from dangerous wildfires.

"The cooperative efforts by the USDA Forest Service, the Alabama Forestry
Commission and local fire departments are remarkable," said Miera C. Nagy,
Forest Service supervisor for Alabama's national forests. "We are taking an all
lands approach as we work together to help prevent wildfires through the use of
control burns and education; and we respond to wildfire threats that could
destroy forests or property."

Just recently, firefighters successfully saved several homes in northeast
Alabama from destruction. According to Jeremy Brand, a U.S. Forest Service
assistant fire management officer for the Talladega District, firefighters were
suppressing a wildfire on the top side of a ridge approximately 3 miles south of
Piedmont, Alabama. Suddenly, while fighting the wildfire in the Talladega
National Forest, members of the fire crew spotted a second blaze to the west
that appeared to be dangerously close to the edge of Piedmont. The firefighters
worked their way down the ridge to the scene of the new wildfire. "We ordered
the use of the helicopter that was being used by the Forest Service to observe
what was being threatened," said Brand. They reported back that a number of
homes were in the path of the wildfire.

Kenneth Harbison, an Alabama Forestry Commission employee, contacted the
landowners and served as a liaison with them to identify possible water sources.
Bucket drops of water from the Forest Service's helicopter were used to slow the
advance of the wildfire until the Alabama Forestry Commission's bulldozer
arrived on site to create a fire break.

This is just one of many examples where the two agencies work together for
Alabamians. A cooperative fire agreement between the Forest Service and the
Alabama Forestry Commission allows the agencies to share resources to respond to
emergencies. The partnership brings state and federal natural resource managers
together to develop solutions to manage threats that impact all boundaries such
as wildfires, southern pines beetles or cogongrass.

"With the reduction of Alabama Forestry Commission personnel, it's critical that
we work together for the safety of all Alabama citizens," said State Forester
Linda Casey. Since September 1, Alabama Forestry Commission firefighters have
responded to 1,203 wildfires in the state, damaging 10,488 acres. This year, the
Forest Service responded to 39 wildfires that took place in Alabama's national
forests.

Dry conditions increase the chance of intensity of a wildfire. A build-up of
fuels, such as dead tress and brush, when combined with drought, causes a
tinderbox. Conditions in many areas are described as potentially explosive for
wildfires.

The hot and dry late summer weather conditions, along with lower than average
rainfall prompted the Alabama Forestry Commission and the Forest Service to
issue fire alerts that restricts outdoor burning and fire use. Please contact a
Forest Service district officer before your trip, and check the bulletin boards
when you arrive for current restrictions and safety messages. Safety is a number
one concern for all forest visitors, especially hunters, hikers and other
outdoor enthusiasts who really utilize the national forest during the fall
season.

Contact a local Alabama Forestry Commission Office if you plan to burn on your
own property. Because conditions are dangerously dry,, there may be burn
restrictions or special permits to obtain before you can light a fire.

If you must burn, be smart. Stay with your fire, have water and tools to smother
the fire, keep a telephone nearby in case of an emergency, and don't leave your
fire until it is cold to the touch. Crush cigarettes in ashtrays while driving
and refrain from parking motorized vehicles in dry brush. If a wildfire is
spotted, call 911 to notify local authorities.

For more information about fire restrictions or wildfire alerts, visit these
websites: www.forestry. alabama.gov; www.fs.fed. us/r8/alabama; or contact the
U.S. Forest Service at 334-832-4470 and the Alabama Forestry Commission at
334-240-9357.

Washington: Regional modeling of large wildfires under current and potential
future climates in Colorado and Wyoming, USA

LENGTH: 284  words



 Washington: US Geological Survey has issued the following news release:



 Regional analysis of large wildfire potential given climate change scenarios is
crucial to understanding areas most at risk in the future, yet wildfire models
are not often developed and tested at this spatial scale.

We fit three historical climate suitability models for large wildfires (i.e.
[>=] 400 ha) in Colorado andWyoming using topography and decadal climate
averages corresponding to wildfire occurrence at the same temporal scale. The
historical models classified points of known large wildfire occurrence with high
accuracies. Using a novel approach in wildfire modeling, we applied the
historical models to independent climate and wildfire datasets, and the
resulting sensitivities were 0.75, 0.81, and 0.83 for Maxent, Generalized
Linear, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, respectively. We projected
the historic models into future climate space using data from 15 global
circulation models and two representative concentration pathway scenarios. Maps
from these geospatial analyses can be used to evaluate the changing spatial
distribution of climate suitability of large wildfires in these states. April
relative humidity was the most important covariate in all models, providing
insight to the climate space of large wildfires in this region. These methods
incorporate monthly and seasonal climate averages at a spatial resolution
relevant to land management (i.e. 1 km2) and provide a tool that can be modified
for other regions of North America, or adapted for other parts of the world.

Chubb Urges Homeowners in Wildfire Areas to Use Fire-Resistive Construction
Materials

LENGTH: 504  words


June 24 -- People living in areas prone to wildfires are likely aware that their
homes are at risk when the temperatures rise and the humidity drops. But
advances in construction materials over the years have added an extra layer of
security for those who are building or renovating homes in high-risk wildfire
areas.



"There are a lot of things that homeowners can do to reduce the likelihood that
their homes will be destroyed by wildfire, but almost nothing can stop hot
embers from blowing onto roofs and decks," said Kevin Fuhriman, catastrophe
manager for Chubb Personal Insurance. "That's why it is encouraging to see that
the construction industry and fire officials are promoting the use of building
materials that can withstand the ember storms caused by wildfires."

Chubb Wildfire Defense Services provides wildfire education and property risk
assessments to Chubb homeowners customers in 14 Western states and can respond
to wildfires through a network of certified wildfire fighters that takes various
measures, including moving lawn furniture indoors, setting up temporary
perimeter sprinkler systems and, if necessary, applying a highly effective
fire-blocking gel to the house.

For those in wildfire-prone areas who are planning to build or renovate their
homes, Fuhriman recommends they consider fire-resistive construction, such as:

Roofs: Cedar shake and wooden shingles are like kindling and should not be used.
The best options are concrete shingles and tiles, clay tiles and slate. Other
options are metal roofs and fiber-cement shingles.

Exterior walls: Construct walls with ignition-resistant building materials, such
as stucco, fiber cement, corrugated steel siding or fire-retardant, treated
wood. Be sure to extend materials from the foundation to the roof.

Windows: Metal frame windows are best. If vinyl clad, choose those with metal
reinforcements at the tops and sides. Vinyl clad can melt and sag if not
reinforced, opening gaps to the inside. Limit the size and number of windows
that face large areas of vegetation. Dual-pane windows are recommended with one
pane of tempered glass to reduce the chance of breakage. Use metal screens that
will not ignite when falling embers strike.

Decks and porches: Decks attached to a home or within 10 feet of the building
should be built with ignition-resistant or non-combustible materials. It is best
to enclose the area beneath decks to prevent flammable yard debris from
accumulating there. Concrete and stones are best for porches.

Vents: Install flame- and ember-resistive vents to help prevent burning embers
from entering the home.

Chimney: Cover the chimney and stovepipe outlets with a non-combustible screen.
Use metal screen material to prevent embers from escaping and igniting a fire.

Garage: Install weather stripping around and under the garage door to prevent
embers from entering.

Other structures: Sheds, fences, awnings, patio furniture, trash cans and
welcome mats are often made from flammable materials and should be kept away
from the house.

Washington: Greg Walden applauds wildfire funding request, call for forest
management reform from administration

LENGTH: 607  words



Washington: Office of the MP Greg Walden has issued the following news release:

 Rep. Greg Walden (R-Hood River) today applauded additional wildfire funds and a
call to action on forest management reform from the administration. The Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) today included $576.5 million in wildfire funding
in their supplemental budget request to Congress, as well as recommendations
that active forest management and forestry reform be part of the solution to
curb wildfire borrowing.


"I want to thank the Trump Administration for their request for funds to cover
the costs of this fire season, as well as their call for Congress to reform our
broken federal forest policy that hinders them from implementing much needed
forest management.  Another fire season winds down and, once again, the Forest
Service needed to rob money from important fire prevention work to pay for
fighting wildfires. We must not only supplement those accounts to pay for the
cost of this fire season, but it's past time that we fix how we pay for fires
and treat them like the natural disasters they are," said Walden. "We also need
to streamline our federal forest policy so forest managers can get the much
needed fire prevention work done to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire that
choke our skies and communities with smoke. I look forward to working with the
administration and my colleagues in the House to improve forest management and
prevent catastrophic wildfire."
Walden led a letter signed by a bipartisan group of 31 lawmakers (will link to
letter) to OMB Director Mick Mulvaney to ask that wildfires be treated like
natural disasters, and that the administration work with Congress to pass forest
management reforms.
"Mismanagement has left our forests vulnerable to insects and disease and ripe
for catastrophic wildfires. The system is broken. We need forest management
reforms, and we need them now," the lawmakers wrote. "We ask that you work with
us to help to fix the way we manage our forests and how we pay for wildfire
disasters. Two goals we can all agree on are reducing the costs of these fires
and breaking out of this destructive, nationwide wildfire cycle."
Walden has spoken with the administration in recent weeks to call their
attention to the severity of this year's fire season in Oregon and throughout
the West, and the need to improve forest management. The supplemental request
issued by OMB this afternoon says that forest management reform must be part of
any long-term solution to prevent catastrophic fires.
"The Administration believes that the problem of wildfire 'borrowing' must be
addressed in a more structured, long-term manner. However, additional funding
alone will not reverse the worsening trend of catastrophic wildfires that
threaten our forests, critical habitats, and communities that border public
lands," the request states. "Active forest management and other reforms must be
part of the solution to curb the cost and destruction of wildfires."
The administration's announcement comes as Walden led a hearing today to examine
the air quality impacts of catastrophic wildfires. During the hearing, Walden
stressed the need to fix the wildfire funding problem cited in the
administration's request often referred to as "fire borrowing".
"Every year we repeat this stupid, stupid cycle. Robbing the accounts that would
do the forest thinning to pay for the firefighting while the fires are going on,
so we don't do the preventive work because we have to pay for the fire," said
Walden. "It makes no sense. It is four to five times more expensive to fight
fires than to do the treatment."

Sinema, Arizona Lawmakers Work to Ensure Federal Hiring Freeze Does Not Threaten
Public Safety

BYLINE: Jeremy Duda

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 663  words


WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema (AZ-09) led a group of
members, including Arizona Congressmen Tom O'Halleran (AZ-01), Andy Biggs
(AZ-05), and Trent Franks (AZ-08), in sending a letter to the Office of
Personnel Management requesting clarity on whether the administration's federal
employee hiring freeze prohibits the U.S. Forest Service from hiring seasonal
firefighters for wildfire season.

"As members of Congress who represent states impacted annually by wildfires, we
are concerned this hiring freeze may prohibit the U.S. Forest Service from
hiring seasonal firefighters and other professionals in anticipation of wildfire
season," the members wrote. "An inability to hire seasonal firefighters to
combat wildfires seriously threatens public safety in our states."

According to the National Federation of Federal Employees, the Forest Service
hired at least 6,200 seasonal workers for firefighting or firefighting-related
duties in 2015. These seasonal firefighters supplement state and local
firefighters' efforts to prepare for wildfire season and contain wildfires as
they emerge. In order to ensure they are trained and ready for wildfire season,
the Forest Service's hiring process traditionally begins over the next several
weeks with a series of job fairs in wildfire-prone states.

Kathleen McGettigan

Acting Director

U.S. Office of Personnel Management

1900 E. Street NW

Washington, DC 20415

Dear Acting Director McGettigan:

We write regarding the Administration's recent decision to impose an
across-the-board hiring freeze of federal workers. As Members of Congress who
represent states impacted annually by wildfires, we are concerned this hiring
freeze prohibits the U.S. Forest Service from hiring seasonal firefighters and
other professionals in anticipation of wildfire season.

Upon taking office, the President signed a memorandum freezing hiring of federal
civilian employees in the executive branch, with a stated exception of the
military. On January 25, 2017, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued
guidance directing agencies to hire workers offered a job on or before January
22ndand have documentation showing a start date of February 22ndor earlier.
Agencies may revoke other existing job offers at their discretion. The OMB
guidance gives OPM the authority to grant limited exceptions for national
security or public safety.

According to the National Federal of Federal Employees, the Forest Service hired
at least 6,200 seasonal workers for firefighting or firefighting-related duties
in 2015. These seasonal firefighters supplement state and local firefighters to
prepare for wildfire season and contain wildfires as they emerge. In order to
ensure they are trained and ready for wildfire season, the Forest Service's
hiring process traditionally begins over the next several weeks with a series of
job fairs in wildfire-prone states. We are concerned that this process will be
interrupted, delayed, or prohibited by the Administration's hiring freeze.

We recognize that additional guidance on this matter is forthcoming. If OPM
determines that an exception to the Administration's hiring freeze is necessary
for the Forest Service to hire seasonal firefighters, we respectfully urge you
to grant one for public safety purposes. Sufficient staffing at the Forest
Service help keep our families, homes, and businesses safe from wildfires.

Should you have questions or need additional information, please contact Michael
Wong with Congresswoman Sinema's office atMichael.Wong@mail.house.gov Thank you
in advance for your consideration and your attention to this request.

Sincerely,

Kyrsten Sinema Scott Tipton

Wildfire southeast of Telegraph Cove now 50 per cent contained

BYLINE: Tyson Whitney

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 221 words


As of Monday, Aug. 14, The wildfire 25 kilometres southeast of Telegraph Cove is
81 hectares in size and is at 50 per cent containment since being discovered
last week.

"We have a 10 person crew assigned to the fire today, and one officer," said
Fire Information Officer Nicole Gagnon.

"There is no equipment and no helicopters currently assigned to the fire."

The wildfire, which is burning in a logging cut block in the Kaikash Creek area,
was 25 hectares in size when it was first discovered Tuesday, Aug. 9.

It then exploded to 80 hectares by the next morning, being classified as "not
under control."

Gagnon noted the terrain at the scene of the wildfire is rugged and steep,
making it difficult for BC Wildfire Service to access the area.

She said BC Wildfire Service "started burn off operations" last Thursday, which
means they used controlled burning to help bring the fire to a controlled
perimeter.

Gagnon said the cause of the wildfire is still unknown and under investigation.

There have been over 1,000 fires in B.C. this wildfire season.

Compared to the last 10 years, that number remains low - while 2016 had only
1,050 fires, 2015 had 1,858 and 2009 had 3,064 fires.

Fighting the wildfires has cost the province $285.2 million.

throughout the week.

Report warns of rising 'mega-fire' risk in B.C.; Firefighting won't be enough to
stop devastating blazes; study calls for new emphasis on prevention

BYLINE: Bethany Lindsay and Larry Pynn, Vancouver Sun

As the planet heats up and the risk of "mega-fires" rises, B.C. will no longer
be able to lean on its world-class wildfire-fighting teams to keep people and
property safe, according to a draft provincial document.

The Forests Ministry paper, called Climate Change Adaption Action Plan for
Wildfire Management 2014-2024, suggests fire prevention should become the
province's top priority.

"It is not an option to continue to increase fire suppression response and
associated

costs, because even the most aggressive action would neither be safe nor
effective for the extreme wildfire events such as those seen in Kelowna in 2003
and Slave Lake in 2010," reads the draft, obtained through an access to
information request.

"During these events, suppression response cannot be relied upon to protect
communities or natural resource values.

The only protection provided will be the protection established before the fire,
provided through wildland-urban interface fuel reduction and landscape fire
management." The document, dated last April, says the average temperature in
B.C. is predicted to rise by four degrees Celsius by 2080. That warming trend,
combined with the higher rate of wildfire spread in forests affected by the
mountain pine beetle, means that "mega fires" will be increasingly common.

The Insurance Bureau of Canada has predicted that severe wildfires will happen
at least 50 per cent more often by 2050.

Besides the safety concerns, extreme wildfire seasons can have a huge economic
impact. The 2003 fire season cost B.C. $1.3 billion in firefighting costs and
indirect economic losses.

The draft suggests B.C. approach the problem by investing in "fire planning and
management at all scales."

The proposed strategies include encouraging private landowners to participate in
the FireSmart Canada program, which teaches homeowners about planting fire-safe
vegetation and shows developers how to plan projects with wildfire prevention in
mind. The plan also calls for communities in high-risk areas to develop fire
protection strategies that include removing potential fuels like dry brush in
areas where wilderness meets human habitation.

On a broader scale, the draft paper suggests bringing together local
governments, First Nations, the forest industry and natural resource managers to
create a widespread system of fuel breaks - things like roadways and other gaps
in vegetation that can prevent wildfires from spreading. It also calls for fire
prevention measures to be included in all land management planning and
communication strategies to keep the public informed about wildfire risks.

Documents released by the Forests Ministry also include a 2012 discussion paper
from the Wildfire Management Branch that warns of the alarming impacts climate
change - combined with pine-beetle die-off - could have on the size, frequency
and severity of wildfires in the southern Interior.

The report predicts that by 2080, the region will experience: An increase in the
size of major fires, doubling from an average of 7.9 square kilometres to 19
square kilometres.

An increase in the severity of fires, by 40 per cent in spring, 95 per cent in
summer and 30 per cent in fall.

A longer fire season and a 30-per-cent jump in the number of fires.

A four to seven per cent increase in severe fire behaviour, such as crowning,
when fire jumps from the top of one tree to another.

"Along with increasing wildfire potential, the costs of suppression response and
the economic losses will also increase exponentially, including losses to
communities, natural resource values and midterm timber supply," the paper
predicts.

The province in 2004 identified 17,300 square kilometres potentially at risk of
wildfires - 6,850 square kilometres of that high risk. To date, just 430 square
kilometres have been managed to reduce fuels.

"The benefit of this initiative was clearly demonstrated in 2009 and 2010
wildfire seasons when three communities - West Kelowna, Alexis Creek and
Barnhartvale - were spared major wildfire damage as a result of successful fuel
reduction projects," the paper said. As a result of the 2003 Kelowna wildfires
and the 2004 report into those fires, the provincial and federal governments
spent $37 million on a wildfire prevention program. The province added another
$25 million in 2011 to assist local governments and First Nations to reduce the
risk to wildfires.

New wildfires prompt call for vigilance;
After six human-caused blazes were reported in one day, the province is asking
residents to be extra diligent with fire use

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. S2

LENGTH: 435 words


Officials are cautioning B.C. residents after six new humancaused wildfires
erupted in one day in a province already facing a spike in natural wildfires due
to dry, hot conditions.

Of the 62 new wildfires that started on Saturday, about 53 were caused by dry
lightning, said Navi Saini, spokeswoman for the province's Wildfire Management
Branch.

"The fact that six of them were human-caused is a concern for us, especially
because we are expecting more dry lightning in many areas of the province," she
said.

British Columbia has requested help from outside the province, and about 600
extra personnel are on hand to help control the wildfires.

"We really need to make sure these resources can respond to those natural fires
that aren't preventable," Ms. Saini said.

She said campfires, exhaust from a vehicle or equipment, or something as simple
as throwing a cigarette out a window can cause a wildfire in the right weather
conditions.

Nearly 200 wildfires were active on Sunday, and 11 were "of note," meaning they
could endanger people or property. Areas surrounding three fires, including
Euchiniko Lakes, Forres Mountain and Chelaslie River, were under evacuation
orders or warnings.

Visitors to Entiako Provincial Park, near the Chelaslie River fire, were ordered
out, and nearby cabins were evacuated.

Since the beginning of April, nearly 200,000 hectares of forest area has burned
as a result of 887 fires.

Earlier this season, Hudson's Hope and a portion of Kelowna were evacuated due
to aggressive blazes, but no property was damaged and residents have since
returned to their homes.

Ms. Saini said residents should check to make sure their area is not under a
campfire ban and be aware of the wildfire danger rating, high in most of the
province and extreme in some parts.

"As the hot, dry weather does continue, we are expecting a more extreme danger
rating, and it's very important that [people are] extra diligent with fire use,"
Ms. Saini said.

She could not say if more areas could be subject to evacuation orders.

"Usually, with lightning-caused wildfires, it's hard to say how quickly that
fire will grow. It depends on the heat of day," Ms. Saini said. "Wind and heat
are definitely the biggest factors."

About 30 per cent of last year's nearly 2,000 wildfires were caused by people,
according to statistics on the Wildfire Management Branch website. The worst
year for wildfires in the past decade appears to be 2009, which had more than
3,000, with just under 900 caused by people. The same year, a raging forest fire
in Kelowna, B.C., forced thousands to flee their homes and destroyed several
houses.

Govt seeks fund to fight wildfires

LENGTH: 499  words



Kathmandu, May 10 -- Waking up to the fact that deadly forest fires raged in
more than 400 places in 43 districts this year, the government has decided to
create a basket fund to prevent and control wildfires, an official said.

An official at the Ministry of Forest and Soil Conservation (MoFSC) requesting
anonymity said the ministry has prepared a proposal requesting the International
Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) to provide US $ 1.5 million (approx. Rs.
118.5 million) to promote measures to control wildfires. ITTO is an
inter-governmental organisation established under the United Nations in 1986 to
promote sustainable forest management and forest conservation and assists
tropical member countries to adapt such policies to local circumstances and to
implement them in the field through projects. The series of devastating
wildfires on an unprecedented scale in highly fire-prone pine forests at high
altitudes since early this year also claimed 41 lives. "The proposal is in the
initial phase and will be ready to be submitted within a month after necessary
consultations with other stakeholders," said Annapurna Nanda Das, spokesperson
at the ministry. The government will contribute additional US $ 0.5 million (
about Rs. 39.5 million) to the basket fund. Das said the government is also
planning to list forest fires as a natural disaster and give this neglected
calamity a high priority. According to the ministry's data about 4,000 hectares
of land, including in conserved and community forest areas were destroyed. "Due
to lack of effective mechanisms to prevent the devastating impact of wildfires,
the country has gone through a major disaster," he said. Das said, as per the
government's mechanism to control wildfires, the basket fund will be mobilized
to strengthen the capacity and infrastructure to deal with the preventive
measures of wildfire. "The most important work is to create awareness among
local people about preventive measures and build capacity among them to manage
potential threats of wildfire," he said. Unmanaged 'slash and burn' practice
that is common among farmers to create better agricultural productivity sparks
wildfires. Rise in temperatures due to an usually long dry spell was also a
factor. Likewise, there is a need to strengthen institutional mechanisms at the
local, community and government levels to tackle wildfires, Das said. The
information sharing system needs to be effectively maintained to create easy
access to locals and other district level officials during incidents of wildfire
, Das said. "We are in the process of a thorough damage assessment of the recent
wildfires and will work to implement all appropriate mechanisms needed for
controlling wildfires," he said. Meanwhile, officials at MoFSC said that the
ministry has put forth a proposal to the Ministry of Finance requesting the
latter to allocate Rs. 10 million for controlling wildfires in the
country.Published by HT Syndication with permission from EKantipur.com.

Record no. of wildfires

Jan. 9--DINWIDDIE -- The Virginia Department of Forestry said this week that
Virginia suffered a record number of wildfires in 2008, several of which were in
Dinwiddie County.

With 1,322 wildfires in the state totaling 25,704 burned acres, DOF spokesman
Gregg O'Donnell said the number of fires was the highest since 1963. A large
portion of the wildfires, 354, occurred on Feb. 10, the worst fire day in
memory, he said.

"The last time we had more acres burned than last year was 1963," he said.

Of the year's wildfires, 23 were in Dinwiddie County, which left 3,115 acres
charred. By comparison, the county has 244,049 acres of timberland, according to
the DOF Web site. Structural damage amounted to $1,100, O'Donnell said.

Spring fire season, the period during which there is the highest risk for
wildfires, begins Feb. 15 and runs through April 30. Several factors combine to
make that stretch more dangerous, he said.

"During winter months the leaves, limbs, grass get really dry. Humidities are
usually pretty low so the risk of fire is (high)," he said. O'Donnell pointed
out that there is not necessarily a higher occurrence of fires during that time
period, but that the risk for wildfire is greater because of those factors.

Causes of wildfires are typically human, he said. Campfires, cigarettes, and hot
ash or embers from fireplaces and wood-burning stoves are common firestarters.
Mechanical equipment left running also has a chance to cause fires by heating
dry or long grass if not supervised, he said.

"Humans continue to be the No. 1 reason for wildfires," he said.

During the spring fire season a burn law prohibits Virginia residents from
burning before 4 p.m. O'Donnell asked Tri-City area residents to use common
sense and caution in the upcoming months if they have to burn something.

Some of the advice he gave included keeping water on hand to control the burn,
clearing a perimeter for the fire, and enclosing the fire in a brick or rock
circle.

"We would hope the common sense would kick in and people wouldn't burn, even
though by law they can," he said.

Interface;
A Phone That Plays Secretary for Travelers

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

SECTION: Section 3;  Page 10;  Column 4;  Financial Desk

LENGTH: 626 words


BARRY McCURDY, senior vice president of research for the investment banking firm
First Albany, recently found an assistant who doesn't sleep, eat or take
weekends off.

Mr. McCurdy and his company have been testing a new telephone-based electronic
assistant that not only answers and places calls, but schedules follow-up calls,
offers reminders for appointments and tracks down an executive on the road to
receive an important call. And if the executive is already on the phone, the
assistant will whisper in his or her ear the name of a waiting caller, so the
executive can decide whether to take the call.

The system is called Wildfire Assistant. And so pleased with the test are Mr.
McCurdy and his firm that they've placed an order for a $69,000 version that can
serve up to 48 First Albany executives and employees.

The maker, Wildfire Communications Inc., a Lexington, Mass., start-up that
announced the product's general availability last week, hopes to find many other
buyers among the road warriors of the business world: salespeople, consultants,
project managers and executives who do much of their work while traveling.

"If a person has no secretary or anyone else who is directly responsible for
their whereabouts when they're out of the office, this really gives the person
an assistant," said Andrew Seybold, an analyst and editor in chief of the
publication Outlook on Mobile Computing, who sees a large market for Wildfire.

Based on a series of emerging technologies, from speech recognition to
object-oriented computer programming languages, Wildfire Assistant is built
around a Pentium-class personal computer installed at the customer's home
office.

To give it the one-number, find-me-anywhere routing capabilities that enable a
group of executives to have their calls forwarded to wherever they choose,
Wildfire requires high-capacity connections to the public telephone network of
T1 lines -- each the equivalent of 24 individual phone lines. In current
versions of the product, a system cable of serving 72 roaming executives would
cost $94,000.

What separates Wildfire from most other voice-mail and messaging systems is its
ability to be accessed completely through the use of natural language. "When I'm
driving, the last thing I need is to look up numbers and find names," Mr.
McCurdy said. "I can call Wildfire, get messages, file them if I want to, then
place a call. I don't need the phone number, the system will have it, and it can
be done hands-free."

The product's developers hired a female graduate student to give Wildfire a
businesslike voice. A user outside the office calls in on a toll-free line to
initiate a session. Once connected, the user provides a numerical password and
then says "Wildfire." The system responds "Here I am." As if calling a close
friend or relative, the user need only say "It's me." The system, recognizing
the voice, responds with casual surprise: "Oh, hi."

Although convenient for the travelers, the system may be a bit off-putting to
people trying to call one of those executives.

Unwary callers are greeted by the Wildfire Assistant, asked to state their name
and given a series of options for attempting to communicate with the peripatetic
executive. If instructed to "put the call through" -- one of the options --
Wildfire may reply "This could take a minute." And indeed it might, before
Wildfire returns to say the called party is not available and ask if one would
like to leave a message.

Mr. Seybold, the industry analyst, said that people wanting to reach each other
in an age of any-time, anywhere communications, will simply have to adapt to
such procedures. "Not too many years ago," he noted, "people hung up, rather
than talk to answering machines."

Research suggests where there's smoke, there's dire consequences

BYLINE: Chris Mooney

SECTION: ASECTION; Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 820 words


As firefighters continue to battle California's devastating Thomas fire now the
fourth largest in state history a group of scientists presented new results
suggesting that air pollution from such massive blazes may be one of their
deadliest consequences.

Speaking at the annual American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans, the
researchers, from Colorado State University and the University of Houston,
suggested Thursday that wildfires may be responsible for thousands of U.S.
deaths annually due to the tiny pollution particles they put into the
atmosphere. Moreover, just as fires are expected to worsen under climate
warming, so might these health impacts.

"If this is the new norm for California and people in California are being
exposed to these smoke events regularly, then we would expect this to have an
impact on the average lifetime of people in California," said CSU professor of
atmospheric science Jeffrey Pierce, who presented his preliminary results at the
meeting and a news conference afterward.

Just like smokestacks and tailpipes, wildfires fill the air with the byproducts
of combustion, including very dangerous small particles known as PM2.5, which
can get into the lungs and bloodstream. A growing body of research has
demonstrated that these particles degrade health and contribute to thousands of
deaths each year in the United States alone by causing respiratory,
cardiovascular and other health problems.

So just how deadly is the smoke from wildfires? While the numbers presented this
week are definitely preliminary, they suggest the cost could be severe indeed.

Pierce presented the highest numbers at the meeting. He estimates that between
5,000 and 25,000 people in the U.S. may die each year at present from PM2.5 that
specifically comes from the smoke of wildfires burning in the United States and
other nearby countries (such as Canada). But the number of wildfire linked
deaths could triple by the end of the century for high levels of global warming,
he has found, based on one climate modeling scenario (which, Pierce emphasizes,
is only a preliminary finding and should be replicated by other scientific
groups).

That would lead to a situation in which, as other sources of air pollution
decline, wildfires become an increasingly dominant overall source of PM2.5.

"Coal plants have gotten cleaner, wildfires have slightly increased over the
past decades, so, wildfires are on the verge of becoming, if they haven't
become, the largest source of particulate matter in the U.S.," said Pierce in an
interview.

Pierce's results, not yet published formally, are similar to those of Ebrahim
Eslami, a Ph.D. student at the University of Houston who also presented at the
meeting on wildfire related air pollution deaths. He has found that wildfires
and other burning of biomass, such as in the agricultural sector, contribute to
around 5,000 deaths per year. That equates to annual economic damages between
$40 and $50 billion for the period between 2011 and 2014.

"Billions of dollars, or tens of billions of dollars, that's the magnitude of
the cost caused by wildfires due to health impact incidence," Eslami said.

The studies include not only the effects of raging wildfires, but also
controlled burns, in which forest managers deliberately light fires to burn away
some of the fuel and reduce the danger of more dangerous outbreaks later. The
health effects are of course not evenly distributed they are the worst in areas
closest to large wildfires, such as California, the Pacific Northwest and U.S.
southeast.

While Pierce's and Eslami's results are not yet formally published, they don't
sound so different from a just published result from a group of scientists with
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and several Australian institutions.
These researchers found that "short term" premature deaths tied to wildfire air
pollution in the U.S. from 2008 through 2012 numbered between 1,500 and 2,500
each year. They calculated that the economic toll, meanwhile, was tens of
billions each year.

And these were only short term effects over the longer term, the researchers
calculated even more severe numbers.

Many health outcomes less severe than death are also triggered by wildfire
smoke, particularly in the immediate vicinity of fires, such as asthma attacks.

"A severe short term smoke event increases the number of inhaler refills by an
order of magnitude," said Katelyn O'Dell, a researcher at CSU who is working
with Pierce studying the health effects of wildfires, at the news conference in
New Orleans.

Granted, all of these findings should be taken cautiously, because this research
is fairly novel. Moreover, researchers acknowledge that wildfire smoke differs
in complex ways from other types of air pollution.

"What burns matters," said Manvendra Dubey, a researcher at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, who is also working on the problem of wildfire smoke and its
consequences.

MS Forestry Commission Deploys Wildland Firefighters to Texas

BYLINE: Mississippi Forestry Commission

LENGTH: 521  words


Jackson, MS,  March 21, 2018 --(PR.com)-- The Mississippi Forestry Commission
(MFC) is deploying one Wildland Firefighting strike team with two bulldozers to
Texas, where they will assist state and federal partners with wildfire
suppression efforts. Five MFC Wildland Firefighters traveled overnight arriving
in Merkel, Texas on Tuesday, March 20, 2018.

"We appreciate our employees taking part in these efforts to help our state and
federal partners in Texas. Fighting the destructive power of wildfire means that
our Wildland Firefighters are working in extreme conditions protecting people's
lives, homes, and forestland," said Charlie Morgan, State Forester. "We are
proud of their service and look forward to their safe return home in
approximately two weeks."

On March 18, 2018, the Texas A&M Forest Service reported 111 wildfires that
burned 24,968 acres of land in Texas over the last seven days. North and West
Texas are currently under critical and elevated fire risks.

How the Mississippi Forestry Commission fights wildfires

MFC Wildland Firefighters "fight fire with fire." They plow a fire line (aka
fire break) with bulldozers around the perimeter of the wildfire, then light a
controlled backfire along the inner edge of the fire line to consume the
vegetation - this lack of "fuel" for the wildfire creates a barrier to slow or
stop the spread of the wildfire. However, their job is not yet finished - even
after containment has been reached, wildland firefighters continue to monitor
the area. Since the wind can spread hot embers across fire lines, new spot fires
may occur as far away as one-half mile from the original wildfire that must be
suppressed. Depending on the size, location, wind conditions, and intensity of
the wildfire - it may have to be monitored anywhere from several hours to
several days to make sure the wildfire is no longer a threat to life, property,
or forestland.

Hurricane debris adds to possibility of wildfires

BYLINE: STAFF REPORT

SECTION: NEWCOMERS' GUIDE; Pg. 30D

LENGTH: 409  words



PALM COAST Hurricanes and wildfires dont seem to go together but the aftermath
of last years storms has forestry officials concerned.

After all the storms and rain last summer, most Floridians might think the
threat of wildfires has been reduced but, in fact, the opposite is true, said
Timber Weller, a wildfire mitigation specialist with the Florida Division of
Forestry in Bunnell. One of the legacies of the hurricanes may be an elevated
wildfire risk lasting several years. Unlike populated areas, where hurricane
debris was quickly cleaned up and hauled away, debris from the storms in wooded
areas is extra fuel, making it more likely for wildfires to start and more
difficult to put them out.

Remember what your neighborhood looked like right after the storm? Leaves and
twigs blanketed the ground, trees stripped and branches, large and small,
everywhere, Weller said. Visualize the huge piles of plant debris produced by a
single neighborhood and then multiply that by the hundreds of thousands of acres
of forests throughout Florida. While May and June are the peak months for
wildfires, Weller said the reality is that Florida has a year-round burn season.

If we get rain frequently enough, we dont have a problem, he said. If we dont
get rain, we do have a problem and it doesnt matter what month is on the
calendar. Weller said in addition to the larger amount of potential fuel for
fires, large logs and other debris make it harder for forestry crews to operate
equipment in the woods.

Theres more fuel available and its going to be more difficult to operate, he
said. Its going to be tougher. But there are things homeowners can do to prepare
for wildfire season, said Bill Butler, Palm Coast landscape architect. These
precautions may limit the chances of damage from wildfires:*Remove leaves, pine
straw and debris from roof and rain gutters.*Create defensible space by removing
or reducing flammable material near buildings and provide at least 30 feet of
buffer space between house and potential wildfire fuels.*Landscape with
nonflammable mulch and choose plants that have high moisture content. Healthy,
well-irrigated plants are more resistant to burning.

When it comes down to it, there is just a brief period when a home is exposed to
wildfire, Weller said. If the home can defend itself, it will survive and the
wildfire will move on. Weller said efforts by the Division of Forestry to reduce
wildfire risks have paid off in recent years.

Federal Partners Continue to Take Action to Support Firefighting Efforts in the
West

LENGTH: 777  words



U.S. Department of the Interior has issued the following news release:

In light of the severity of current fire activity, the National Multi-Agency
Coordinating Group (NMAC) has raised the National Fire Preparedness Level (PL)
to 5 - the highest readiness level for wildland fire operations. With more than
60 large, active wildfires burning across 13 states and more than 19,000
interagency personnel deployed, NMAC, which consists of top federal and state
fire managers, raised the preparedness level to reflect a high degree of
wildfire activity, a major commitment of fire resources, and the probability
that severe conditions will continue for at least a few days.

The National Weather Service today also issued red flag and severe fire weather
warnings for several states across the West, including many that are already
experiencing fires.

U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture
Tom Vilsack today highlighted the importance of safety and public awareness as
firefighters work to address the growing threat of catastrophic wildfires in
drought-stricken areas of the West this year.

"The nation's wildland fire community of federal, state, tribal, and local
agencies is working around the clock to ensure all firefighting resources are
available to fight these active wildfires," said Interior Secretary Sally
Jewell. "However, the conditions we are experiencing this fire season are
stretching our resources and may force us to divert funds from prevention and
restoration efforts just to keep up with fire suppression costs. That's why we
need a better way to fund severe fires, similar to how we manage costs for other
natural disasters. This would give us the flexibility to fight these fires
without taking away from important efforts like forest and rangeland
restoration, fuels management and proactive community protection."

The Secretaries also called for reforms in the way the federal government funds
wildfire suppression efforts. Fighting fires continues to impact management of
federal natural resource programs. To cover escalating fire costs, agencies
continue to divert funds from other natural resource management and fire
prevention programs to fund the wildfire suppression efforts.

"Fire seasons are growing longer, hotter, more unpredictable and more expensive
every year, and there is no end in sight. Within just 10 years, two out of every
three dollars the Forest Service gets from Congress will be spent on fire
programs, which leaves much fewer resources for the very restoration projects
that have been proven to reduce the risk of wildfire and improve forest health,"
said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. "We are at a tipping point. Congress
must change the way it pays for wildfires by providing a fiscally responsible
way to treat catastrophic wildfires more like the natural disasters that they
are, end fire transfers, partially replenish our capacity to restore resilient
forests, and protect lives and property against future fires."

During periods of high wildfire activity and when assets are stretched thin,
federal, tribal, state and local partners work together to prioritize wildfires
so that those threatening life, property and valuable natural and cultural
resources receive assets as quickly as possible. Professional wildfire managers
adapt their strategies and tactics to suppress unwanted wildfires effectively
and efficiently.

Wildfire activity has escalated in recent days after thunderstorms - many with
little or no moisture - moved across parts of California, Oregon, Washington,
Idaho and Montana, sparking hundreds of new fires. So far this year, 39,254
wildfires have burned nearly 6.4 million acres in the United States. The number
of wildfires in 2015 represents about 80 percent of the 10-year average.
However, the number of current acres burned represents about a 38 percent
increase over the 10-year average at this point in the year.

The last time that the National Preparedness Level was raised to 5 was on August
20, 2013. The National Preparedness Level remained at 5 for seven days until it
was dropped to 4 on August 26, 2013. This is the fifth time that PL-5 has been
reached in the last 10 years.

The fire forecast for most of the West predicts above normal temperatures, below
normal precipitation, and continuing drought in many areas into the fall.

Communities and individuals play a critical role in preventing fires and
reducing the risks associated with fire. While lightning causes many fires, many
others are caused accidentally.

High-tech service handles your calls Pentium computer is your personal assistant

BYLINE: BY BOB MITCHELL TORONTO STAR

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. E5

LENGTH: 915 words


A Toronto-based company is now providing a way for business people to beat the
voice-mail blues.

It's called Wildfire - a virtual personal assistant - who does everything except
get you a cup of coffee.

Wherever you are in the world, she can find you, if you want to be found. She
works seven days a week, 24 hours a day and never asks for a day off.

She schedules your meetings, reminds you where you have to be and who you have
to call, takes messages and politely screens your calls.

But most importantly, when somebody phones you with an important call, no matter
where you are or what you're doing, she'll make sure that call is connected to
you. And the caller never knows where you are.

Wildfire is actually a souped-up Pentium PC - an electronic personal assistant
that lives in a small office at Don Mills Rd. and Lawrence Ave. - and has taken
on a female voice.

"Wildfire is the complete opposite of voice mail," said Scott Brown, whose
company Talknology Communications Inc. brought the U.S. based state-of-the-art
communication link to Canada six months ago.

Brown says Talknology Communications, which has the Canadian licensing
distribution rights for the U.S. parent company, has a substantial investment in
the product.

Brown's target is to generate $ 1 million of business during the first year of
operation in the Canadian market with a revenue-sharing agreement with the
U.S.-based Wildfire Communications.

"Communications experts have estimated that 75 per cent of the time when you
make a call, you end up getting the person's voice mail," said Brown, who first
saw Wildfire at a U.S. communications trade show two years ago. "That means when
that person tries to call you back, they're probably going to get your voice
mail, too.

'It's a business tool that can be very valuable for people who are always away
from their office'

"We spend all day using the phone without reaching the person you want. Wildfire
changes that."

Wildfire starting salary - after all it replaces a person - begins at $ 49 per
month plus 15 cents per minute after the initial $ 149 activation fee.

Depending on how much you use it, there are various other plans that provide
free minutes. The most popular plan costs $ 129 per month with 600 free minutes.

Those who use it a great deal, like stock brokers who are constantly on the
phone, get 6,400 free minutes each month for $ 399 per month.

Using Wildfire, you almost feel like Star Trek's Captain Kirk standing on the
brig of the Starship Enterprise, commanding the ship's computer to find Scotty
for you.

The voice is that of a real person, a friend of William Warner, of Lexington,
Mass., who came up with the idea of Wildfire in 1987. Warner went on to win a
1993 Emmy and 1994 Academy Award for film editing technology used for special
effects in movies and commercials.

Originally designed for handicapped phone users, Warner soon realized the
technology was also suited for the high-paced business world and Wildfire
Communications was born in 1991. Today, more than 7,500 people living in the
business capitals of the United States are using it.

Rudy Powell, 45, is one of about 60 clients using Wildfire in the Toronto area.

"It's really incredible because even if I'm in Timbuktu, my clients can find
me," said Powell, a self-employed personal financial consultant.

Powell, who spends a lot of time on the phone, particularly in his car, said he
can make dozens of calls without ever dialing because once he's talking to
Wildfire, she takes over.

"Everything is voice activated . . . I don't have to dial anything . . . she
gets all my calls for me," Powell said.

Brown admits Wildfire isn't for everybody.

"It's not a toy . . . it's a business tool that can be very valuable for people
who are always away from their office but absolutely must be able to have people
get in touch with them wherever they are," Brown said. "It's not for the general
public. It's for very specific people with very specific telephone needs."

Brown formerly handled the Pacific Rim accounts for Northern Telecom and was
always travelling. When he first learned of Wildfire, he had his business
adviser look into investing in it.

But instead of investing, they went after the Canadian rights from Warner.

Wildfire users keep their own cell, office and home numbers but are given a new
number to give clients. When clients call that number, Wildfire's pleasant voice
answers.

She'll ask the caller if she should try to locate you or whether you just want
to leave a message.

If the caller wants to contact you immediately, Wildfire goes into action. Armed
with a variety of numbers you've left with her, she'll track you down, and
announce you've got a call from the person on the other line.

At that point, it's up to you whether you take the call. Even if you're already
on the phone, you'll hear a beep and Wildfire will gently whisper into your ear
who is on the other line.

Wildfire maintains a phone book of 150 names and contacts and stores up to five
different numbers for each person.

By using its conference call features, you can take part in meetings while
you're driving or on a pay phone at an airport.

Wildfire will be introduced in Winnipeg by late October and plans call for it to
be available in Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton by next August.

Montreal isn't on the schedule at this stage because the technology is currently
only available in English.

homeowners insurance

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER FLAVELLE

SECTION: BUSINESS; A; Pg. 6

More frequent and intense wildfires are making it harder for homeowners to find
and keep insurance in California, a state regulator warned Thursday.

"The problem of insurance availability is going to expand" after last year's
record-breaking wildfires, California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said in
an interview Thursday. He said growing rates of nonrenewal and rate increases
for people in wildfire zones are "entering a critical stage."

Wildfires were already pinching the availability of coverage in large sections
of the state, new data show. The number of homeowners in fire-prone areas who
complained about getting dropped by their plans increased 250 percent from 2010
to 2016, Jones's department reported Thursday.

In the 24 counties with the greatest wildfire risk, the number of policies
canceled by companies increased 15 percent between 2015 and 2016 alone; in at
least six of those counties, that number grew by more than 50 percent.

California was struck by a series of wildfires starting last fall that damaged
or destroyed more than 14,700 homes, according to the regulator. Those losses
resulted in "more than $9 billion in insured damages so far." One Southern
California fire started in December, known as the Thomas Fire, burned more
acreage than any other blaze in the state's history.

The pressure on California's market is a warning for states elsewhere, according
to climate and industry experts. The number of acres consumed by wildfires each
year has doubled since 2000, according to federal data. The Union of Concerned
Scientists warns that warmer and drier conditions caused by climate change will
mean even more fires. Meanwhile the number of people  in the most fire-prone
areas keeps growing.

"We used to have in this country a wildfire season, and now we have wildfire
risk in multiple states all year long," said Julie Rochman, president of the
Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety, an industry-funded research
group that looks at how to make homes more resilient to extreme weather. She
said rising premiums in California reflect the growing exposure to wildfires,
and people in other states could gradually see their rates become harder to
afford as well.

In Thursday's report, the regulator urged lawmakers for changes that would make
it harder for companies to increase rates or cancel coverage. Those proposals
include preventing carriers from dropping homeowners that take specific steps to
reduce their wildfire exposure, requiring insurers to seek state approval for
the models they use to calculate wildfire risk, and letting homeowners appeal
those risk calculations.

Providers of residential coverage say they will resist any changes that make it
harder for them to sell policies that reflect the true risk of wildfires. That
would force insurers to charge higher premiums in safer parts of the state,
according to Rex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of
California, which represents the industry.

"Of course, people who choose to live in the forest and local governments that
continue to approve development in the forest would like less fire-prone areas
to subsidize them," Frazier said by email. "But that just 'solves' one problem
by creating another."

Insurers weren't the only ones to warn about reducing the cost of coverage in
wildfire zones. Alice Hill, a senior adviser on climate resilience to President
Barack Obama, said people thinking about buying homes in wildfire areas should
instead use the cost of protection as an indication of whether it's a good idea
to buy there.

"When we see insurers pulling back from markets, it's because the risk is
increasing," Hill, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, said by phone.
"If those risks are getting too high, it's a strong signal that we need to
change our ways."

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 264 words


April 10--BEMIDJI -- The danger of wildfires continues to increase in the
Bemidji area. The Bemidji Fire  Department has responded to 12 wildfire
incidents so far this spring season, as of Friday morning. Debris burning has
been the most common cause of these fires. With the dry conditions, wildfires
are starting easier and spreading very quickly. This fire behavior will likely
continue to worsen until we see significant "green up" of the vegetative
material.

Advertisement

Open burning restrictions are in place throughout the Bemidji area. Any open
burning can only be done with a special variance permit that is issued by the
fire department or Minnesota DNR. Recreational or camp fires used for the
purposes of cooking, warming, and entertainment are still allowed. Area
residents are encourage to use caution this spring as we enter our most active
wildfire period of late April thru the middle of May.

Tips regarding wildfires include: contact 911 if you notice an unattended or
out-of-control wildfire, never leave a recreational fire unattended, do not
discard cigarettes, matches, and smoking materials from moving vehicles or
anywhere in dry vegetative material, be certain to completely extinguish
cigarettes before disposing of them and to be aware that hot vehicle exhausts
and sparks from operating equipment can easily ignite dry grass.

For more information, contact the Bemidji Fire Department or Minnesota DNR.

story has been updated to reflect this.

The wildfire danger rating is rated high around Revelstoke on Sunday, but no
fires have started in the area yet.

Earlier Sunday, Wildfire BC upped the danger rating to extreme but they later
downgraded it to high, where it's expected to remain for the next few days.

Throughout the Southeast Fire Centre, the danger rating is a mix of high and
extreme. You can see a map showing danger ratings here:
www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/wildfire-status/fire-danger

A campfire ban went into effect throughout the region on Friday.

The Southeast Fire Centre has yet to experience the catastrophic wildfires that
are raging elsewhere in the province. There are only three active fires in the
region, and all are small.

On Friday, the province declared a state of emergency after wildfire activity
accelerated throughout the Central Interior, forcing the evacuation of several
communities and destroying people's homes.

There are 230 wildfires burning across the province as of Sunday morning.

"It's safe to say the majority of these fires are burning out of control," said
Kevin Skrepnek, the chief fire information officer for Wildfire BC. More: Crews

Q5: Spring increases risk of wildfires

BYLINE: Megan Sando, Stillwater NewsPress, Okla.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 490 words


March 21--As the state's temperatures increase, so does the possibility for
wildfires. Payne County had devastating wildfires that destroyed land and
property in 2012. Emergency responders like county Emergency Management Director
Jeff Kuhn make it possible to respond to serious wildfires and help people in
time of need.

1 What makes Oklahoma susceptible to wildfires this time of year?

Oklahoma experiences wildfires this time of year because we still have dormant
vegetation left over from the winter. We also have days of very low humidity and
warm temperatures. This time of year we see drylines set up in western Oklahoma
and move eastward across the state.

These drylines sometimes cause storms, but they also aggravate wildfire concerns
because of the low humidities and strong winds and high temperatures behind the
drylines. This time of year, we also have people burning brush piles and burning
off pastures to control cedar infestations.

2 What are long-term wildfire conditions looking like for Payne County?

It is impossible to say what the long-term wildfire conditions will be like in
the months to come. At the present time, the recent rains and warmer
temperatures have allowed the grass to green up some and our humidities have
been higher. Only time will tell if we continue to get rainfall to keep the
vegetation from going dormant and keep the moisture content high in the fuels.

3 How will the public know if a burn ban happens?

At the present time, I do not believe the County Commissioners will put on a
burn ban this spring. We do not meet the criteria set up by the state to allow
them to do so, and the residents of Payne County have been careful in burning
and we have not seen an abundance of fires.  Should the Commissioners put on a
burn ban, I will post it on the Payne County Emergency Management app and it
will be posted on the Payne County webpage. It will also be posted on the state
forestry web page and in the newspapers.

4 When was the last ban and why was it put in place?

I believe the last burn ban issued for Payne County was actually issued by the
governor after the large fires around Logan County and Oklahoma County. The
purpose of burn bans is to try to keep the number of wildfires down so
firefighters will not be overwhelmed by several fires burning at the same time.
Even though, we have many fire departments and they do an extremely good job of
fighting fires, they can be overwhelmed when numerous large fires are burning at
the same time. It takes a lot of resources to fight a large wildfire and we can
run out of resources, as we saw in 2012.

5 Where can people go for more information?

The best source of information about wildfires is found on the state forestry
website. It can be found at www.forestry.ok.gov

POLK'S WILDFIRE SEASON SECOND WORST ON RECORD

BYLINE: BILL BAIR The Ledger

SECTION: News; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 1456 words


LAKE WALES -- For much of this year, Robin Whitaker, a forest ranger in the
Florida Division of Forestry's Dundee office, said firefighters "would be lucky
if we got home every couple of days."

It's summertime and the living has gotten a little easier for firefighters.

Summer rains have ended what had been the second-worst wildfire season in Polk
County since 1981, the period for which records are available.

"We get off at 5 now," Whitaker said.

Above average rainfall in June, July and so far this month have all but
eliminated the threat of wildfires.

The drought index, which neared the 700 mark earlier this year in Polk County,
now stands at 44. The index, which measures the moisture content in the top 8
inches of soil, ranges from a soggy zero to a desert-dry 800, with the danger of
fire rising along with the dryness. Firefighters expect problems any time the
index rises above 400. The index in Polk neared the 700 mark during March.

But officials fear the reprieve may be temporary.

Even with recent rains, lakes and groundwater tables remain lower than they were
at this time last year.

Mark Hebb, who heads the Lakeland-based district of the Florida Division of
Forestry, said a lot more rain will be needed to reduce the threat of wildfires
during the next dry season, which typically begins in October and lasts through
May.

In normal years, Hebb expects the wildfire season to begin about three weeks
after the first freeze kills and dries vegetation. Typically, that season begins
about the end of January.

Without a great deal more rain, Hebb fears Polk County could start seeing a
serious wildfire danger again as early as November.

Already this year, the Division of Forestry has worked fires that charred 26,440
acres.

Not since 1981, when 49,290 acres burned, have wildfires covered a greater area
in Polk County.

Much of this year's total is attributed to a fire that closed Interstate 4 for a
week as it charred 10,119 acres near Polk City.

Hebb said the wildfire season could have been much worse.

In terms of the number of fires, Hebb said, the agency worked 217. There have
only been four years since 1981 when there were fewer fires worked by the
Division of Forestry in Polk County.

In 1981, which had the highest number, the agency dealt with 711 fires.

But the numbers are not inclusive.

Polk County Fire Services, for example, responded to 1,003 wildfire calls this
year.

Fire Chief Bill Gunter said Polk County does not keep acreage records and has no
way of knowing which fires the Division of Forestry also worked.

"It's hard to put that figure together," Gunter said.

And Polk County Fire Services figures do not include wildfires municipal fire
departments work.

HOUSES SAVED

Hebb credits a stepped-up response by fire departments, interagency cooperation
and public awareness for reducing the number and severity of wildfires.

No occupied houses were lost to wildfires this year, although the fire near Polk
City destroyed a horse barn.

The techniques in fighting the wildfires and the coordination of agencies was a
result of the lessons learned in 1998, when 2,300 fires burned more than 300
homes in Florida, largely on the East Coast, and forced the evacuation of 50,000
people. Because of that experience, Hebb said, "the system has just refined
itself," emphasizing cooperation among agencies.

Hebb said no single agency has the staff or equipment to handle a major wildfire
on its own.

As the fire danger increased this year, Polk County Fire Services stepped up its
response, pre-positioning equipment and firefighters in danger areas and
responding to all wildfire calls with extra units.

In addition, the Division of Forestry is increasingly relying on quick response
by aircraft, both helicopters and tankers, when wildfires threaten to escape.

All of that cooperation was evident in April, when units from every fire
department in Polk County responded to a fast-moving wildfire at Indian Lake
Estates.

Because of the amount of dense vegetation the sprawling development east of Lake
Wales is considered a "critical concern target" by firefighters, who have
pre-planned their responses to wildfires in the such developments.

While there are more than 8,000 half-acre lots, only about 400 homes have been
built and most of the land remains undeveloped.

When fires hit in such areas, Division of Forestry crews are generally
responsible for cutting fire lines and aerial water drops, while local fire
departments leap-frog from house to house to provide protection.

LOOKING BACK

While Division of Forestry records date only to 1981, Hebb said historically the
number of acres burned annually would probably have been far greater than today.

Much of Florida's wildlife habitat is actually dependent on fire.

Before the area was settled, lightning strikes would annually set fires, which
often burned until they hit an area that had been burned a year or so earlier.

Later, landowners used fire to reduce underbrush and renew pastures.

Because of frequent burning, there was no buildup of fuel, Hebb said.

That's not the case today.

Hebb said it is more difficult to do controlled burns because of "people moving
into the woods."

Because of that development, wildfires must be contained more quickly, he said.

Ironically, Hebb said the rains that have reduced the fire danger also make it
difficult for the Division of Forestry and landowners to do controlled burns
this summer.

Hebb said the best opportunity for such burning is after the rainy season,
before the threat of wildfires becomes severe.

But that window of opportunity may again be limited this year, if the fire
danger increases rapidly.

As a result, Hebb said the Division of Forestry is using mechanical means to
reduce the threat of wildfires.

He said fire breaks are being plowed in developments such as Indian Lake Estates
east of Lake Wales, where houses are interspersed among pine woods and
palmettos.

On the positive side, Hebb said, the fire "risk has been significantly reduced
for the next five years" on the 26,440 acres that burned this year. That
includes the more than 10,000 acres along Interstate 4.

But Hebb said, another 200,000 acres of the Green Swamp area of Polk County are
susceptible to wildfires.

Hebb said many developments have only one entrance, making it difficult to get
to a fire or to evacuate neighborhoods, particularly if the fire includes the
only road.

He said fire officials want developers to put in more than one entrance and will
discuss how to deal with subdivisions that have only one.

IF YOU GO

Ways to reduce the danger of wildfires will be the subject of a seminar
sponsored by the Division of Forestry beginning at 8 a.m. Thursday at Nora Mayo
Hall on Third Street Northwest in downtown Winter Haven. The seminar will deal
with such subjects as materials to be used for roofs, clearing of buffer zones
around houses, setbacks from wooded areas and road access.

LAND OF FIRE

These are the wildfires fought by Florida Division of Forestry workers in the
Lakeland-based district and statewide from 1981 to 2001. The district includes
Polk, Hillsborough and Pinellas counties. Comprehensive totals including local
fire departments and other agencies were not available.

Boulder County inviting mountain residents to be Wildfire Partners

BYLINE: Joe Rubino, Camera Staff Writer

SECTION: LOCAL

LENGTH: 725 words


Want to become a Wildfire Partner?

Applications for the program  are available at wildfirepartners.org. People may
also apply over the phone by calling 303-446-7877.

 The deadline to apply is March 3.









 After taking over as chief of the Sunshine Fire Protection District in the
aftermath of the Fourmile Fire, Brett Haberstick saw firsthand the difficulties
of recovering from such a disaster.



 The blaze in 2010 destroyed 169 homes in western Boulder County, at the time
making it the most destructive fire in Colorado history and dramatically
changing the face of many mountain communities.

 Haberstick, also a volunteer firefighter and former fire marshall for the
Sunshine district, said his experiences following Fourmile also served to
further emphasize the importance of wildfire mitigation.

 "Anything I could do before an event that would make it safe for my
firefighters before they go into a situation  I became very passionate about,"
Haberstick said. "What can be done before a wildfire occurs  is extremely
important."

 In the coming months, Haberstick and a nine  other experts will be embracing
his passion for wildfire mitigation in an innovative  way. They will be serving
as wildfire mitigation specialists that will counsel area homeowners on how to
protect their properties from the threat as part of the Boulder County's new
Wildfire Partners program.

 Boulder County officials are seeking to enroll qualified homeowners now for the
first year program.

 It  offers participants an individual, on-site wildfire risk assessment of
their homes with a specialist like Haberstick, and a custom report on the
weaknesses of their fire      defenses in advance of a follow-up inspection to
ensure recommended mitigation measures have been enacted. Enrollees also will
have access to wildfire phone advisors, and will be eligible for a minimum $300
in rebates for their mitigation efforts at the conclusion of the program,
according to county officials.

 "Wildfire Partners is a new approach," said Jim Webster, the program
coordinator. "For one, it's   the largest pot of financial incentive we've ever
had to offer homeowners."

 Webster said the program, funded through a $980,000 wildfire risk reduction
grant from the   Colorado Department of Natural Resources, has $250,000 set
aside to reimburse participants for the efforts in the program's first year, and
funding is being gathered to keep the program going in the future.

 Examples of things mitigation specialists might look for at a home include wood
mulch that is up against the structure and should be replaced by something
non-combustible, or vents that are not properly screened and could allow forest
fire embers to enter the home, Webster said.

 "The assessment provides an expert's eye to identify those weak links that
people may have forgotten or haven't done yet," he said. "There are some really
simple steps that people can do in advance of a fire that can prevent their home
from being destroyed."

 Department of Natural Resources Assistant Director Lisa Dale is in charge of
administering   the state's $9.8 million wildfire risk reduction grant program
which was established by statute last year. While she said wildfire mitigation
is not a new idea, the Wildfire Partners program impressed her because of the
level of outreach county officials planned to do to get homeowners involved
instead of waiting for them to reach out for help.

 "We're excited about it," she said. "Boulder County has done a really good job
of being proactive, and I think people are looking at Boulder County and
adopting some of their ideas."

 Webster said the county is aiming to enroll 500 homeowners in the program in
2014, with  plans to place applicants who are not approved on a waiting list for
next year. Applicants must live in unincorporated western Boulder County, or the
towns of Ward, Nederland, Jamestown or Lyons and agree to complete the
recommended fire mitigation measures to be eligible.

 The deadline to apply in March 3,

 Haberstick is hopeful lots of people will be interested in the program.

 "I think it's a great opportunity," he said. "A lot of this is about having
conversations. Hopefully we can give people some steps to take to help them
enhance their safety and the safety of others."

Hurricane debris feeds wildfires

BYLINE: STAFF REPORT

SECTION: NEWCOMERS' AND WINTER RESIDENTS'; Pg. 23D

LENGTH: 505  words


PALM COAST Hurricanes and wildfires dont seem to go together but the aftermath
of last years storms have forestry officials concerned.

After all the storms and rain last summer, most Floridians might think the
threat of wildfires has been reduced but in fact, the opposite is true, said
Timber Weller, a wildfire mitigation specialist with the Florida Division of
Forestry in Bunnell. One of the legacies of the hurricanes may be an elevated
wildfire risk lasting several years. Unlike populated areas, where hurricane
debris was cleaned up quickly and hauled away, debris from the storms in wooded
areas is extra fuel, making it more likely for wildfires to start and more
difficult to put out.

Remember what your neighborhood looked like right after the storm; leaves and
twigs blanketed the ground, trees stripped and branches large and small
everywhere, Weller said. Visualize the huge piles of plant debris produced by a
single neighborhood and then multiply that by the hundreds of thousands of acres
of forests throughout Florida. While May and June are the peak months for
wildfires, Weller said the reality is that Florida has a year-round burn season.

If we get rain frequently enough, we dont have a problem, he said. If we dont
get rain, we do have a problem and it doesnt matter what month is on the
calendar. Weller said in addition to the larger amount of potential fuel for
fires, large logs and other debris make it harder for forestry crews to operate
equipment in the woods.

Theres more fuel available and its going to be more difficult to operate, he
said. Its going to be tougher. But there are things homeowners can do to prepare
for wildfire season, said Bill Butler, Palm Coast landscape architect.

The first thing I would say is, if homeowners have any debris on their site, get
them out to the street so the refuse company can pick it up, Butler said. The
important thing is the area around the house. Thats the area homeowners need to
focus on. Homeowners can take precautions to limit the chances of damage from
wildfires, including:*Remove leaves, pine straw and debris from roof and rain
gutters.*Create defensible space by removing or reducing flammable material near
buildings and provide at least 30 feet of buffer space between house and
potential wildfire fuels.*Landscape with nonflammable mulch and choose plants
that have high moisture content. Healthy, well-irrigated plants are more
resistant to burning.

When it comes down to it, there is just a brief period when a home is exposed to
wildfire, Weller said. If the home can defend itself, it will survive and the
wildfire will move on. Weller said efforts by the Division of Forestry to reduce
wildfire risks have paid off in recent years.

Weve seen a reduction in the number of fires over the last couple of years, he
said. However, he said, the risks are still there and that is why homeowners
need to take positive measures to protect themselves.

We know were going to have more fires, he said. We dont know if we have to have
more catastrophes.

Washington: Wyden, Risch, Merkley, Heinrich Urge Congress to Pass Bipartisan
Wildfire Funding Fix in Senate Bill

LENGTH: 349  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Jeff Merkley has issued the following news
release:

As wildfire season rages across Oregon, Idaho and the West, Sens. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore., Jim Risch, R-Idaho, Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Martin Heinrich, D-N.M.,
today urged the Senate to pass a wildfire funding fix included in new
legislation to address funding for floods and other natural disasters.


A wildfire funding fix similar to the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which Wyden
and Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, first introduced in 2013, was included in July in
legislation under consideration by the Senate Banking Committee to reauthorize
the National Flood Insurance Program.
Just like the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, the wildfire funding fix included
in the new legislation would end the cycle of underfunding fire suppression that
currently forces federal agencies to steal from fire prevention to fight fires.

    "Over the years, we have worked to fix fire borrowing in any way we could
find," Wyden, Risch, Merkley and Heinrich wrote in a letter to Crapo and Sen.
Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, on the Senate Banking Committee."Yet year after year,
fire season after fire season, the fires continue to worsen and any attempt at a
fix gets snarled in Washington politics."
    "Along with the reauthorization of these flood and disaster programs, the
Committee also included a provision of great interest to us - a wildfire funding
fix. We write to strongly urge you to ensure this provision remains in the final
bill as it is considered by the Committee and in the full Senate."
The language included in the Senate flood mitigation bill from the Wildfire
Disaster Funding Act would end "fire borrowing" by funding the largest wildfires
from a similar disaster account used to fund other natural disasters.
According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the risk of flooding after
wildfires is "significantly higher" for up to five years after a wildfire. Fires
increase the risk of floods and flash flooding by wiping out trees, shrubs and
other plants that allow soil to absorb rainfall and snowmelt.

Global Warming considered reason behind rise in catastrophic wildfires

BYLINE: Karan Gosal

LENGTH: 296  words


Experts have raised concerns by unveiling that extreme wildfires are taking
place in the Western United States. The blazes are more violent and taking place
at more frequent levels in recent years than they have in the past. New research
has blamed global warming for the same.

Researchers from the University of Wyoming has warned that the world has reached
at such a level that even a slightest increase in average temperature can lead
to dramatic increase in wildlife activity.

The researchers also said that global warming may be bringing alterations and
ushering in an era of high-elevation wildfires that have not been seen in over
1,000 years. Owing to climate change, more than 50,000 wildfires have taken
place.

As per the researchers, the wildfires have burnt more than 9 million acres in
the West and Alaska this year. The researchers said that warming in Alaska is
the major reason behind massive wildfires there this year.

The researchers have gone through charcoal samples representing 2,000 years of
wildfire. The samples have been taken from lake beds in a subalpine forest in
northern Colorado's Mount Zirkel Wilderness near Steamboat Springs.

"Our study then adds more evidence that the recent increase in large wildfires
is related to climate change because the only time we see these types of large
wildfires in the last 2,000 years is when we had a similar amount of warming",
said study's lead researcher John Calder.

"When we look into the past for evidence of these large wildfires we only see
them one time when temperatures rose about 1F," he said

Wildfire Awareness Week: March 27-April 2

BYLINE: From the Current-Argus Submitted to the Current-Argus

LENGTH: 640 words


ALBUQUERQUE -- Governor Susana Martinez has proclaimed March 27 - April 2, 2011
as Wildfire Awareness Week and urges New Mexicans and visitors to the state to
be prepared for wildfires and do their part to prevent wildfires from starting.

High to extreme wildfire danger across the southwestern United States brings
increased meaning to this year's Wildfire Awareness Week theme: Where We Live,
How We Live ? Living with Wildfire in the Southwest. The theme reflects how dry,
windy weather conditions and heavy fuel loads in our forested areas mean higher
wildfire danger, especially as communities expand into the wildland urban
interface.

Local, state, federal and tribal interagency partners held a news conference
today to address statewide wildfire concerns and issues. Agency representatives
read Governor Martinez's proclamation and discussed how best to prevent human
caused wildfires and how we must all be prepared.

"Wildfire has become a part of where we live and how we live in New Mexico and
we all have a role to play in keeping our communities safe," said Acting State
Forester Tony Delfin. "I urge all New Mexicans to be aware of our fire danger
and to make sure they prepared for the eventuality of wildfire."

Overall potential for fire in New Mexico is higher this year than it was in 2010
because of mild winter weather across the southern two-thirds of the state and
consistently dry and windy weather this spring. These weather conditions are
expected to continue through April and May, with little relief as summer begins.

Interagency partners will continue their work with communities to protect lives
and property by training thousands of firefighters in wildland fire skills, and
teaching landowners how to reduce their wildfire threat through land treatment.

"The 2011 wildfire season started early this year in New Mexico" stated Linda
Rundell, BLM-NM State Director "We are asking recreationalists to be very
cautious while out enjoying their public lands and homeowners to clear away
their dead grass and brush from around their homes to create that very important
defensible space."

This year between January-March 27, 2011, New Mexico has experienced 199
wildfires that burned approximately 112,000 acres, a significant increase from
last year at this time when there were 60 fires that burned approximately 11,000
acres.

While fire danger remains high, there are steps state residents and visitors can
take to reduce the potential for loss of life and property:

Create a 30-foot defensible space zone around the home;

Pile firewood and other flammables well away from home and other structures;

Keep access roads free of debris and vegetation to improve access and escape in
case of fire;

Clean off needles and other debris from roofs and gutters;

Consider constructing or renovating with fire resistant building materials;

Prune trees near structures and remove excess ground fuels such as fallen
needles, cones and branches.

While enjoying New Mexico's many forested private and public lands, it is
suggested that residents and visitors:

Know Before You go: Call the statewide toll-free Fire Restriction Hotline at
(877) 864-6985;

Build a campfire in areas approved only such as established campgrounds with
fire grills pits;

Never leave a campfire unattended; be sure it is dead out and cold to the touch
before leaving;

Never park vehicles in tall grass or shrubs where fires can start because hot
catalytic converters may come in contact with dry vegetation;

Never toss lit cigarettes out of cars;

Abide by smoking restrictions in forested areas;

Keep in mind that the use of fireworks is always prohibited on all public lands
including state parks or national forests.

At the mercy of the weather says Cariboo Fire Centre

BYLINE: Monica Lamb-Yorski

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 775 words


Wednesday's weather co-operated in a sense that the wildfires were not activated
as much as the Cariboo Fire Centre had feared, fire information officer Melinda
Pawplaski told the Tribune Thursday morning.

"We ended up seeing a little bit of clouds and the temperature dropped so we did
not get the full effect we planned for and it was not as difficult as we
anticipated."

Today, however, will be another "wait and see" scenario as far as the weather is
concerned, she warned.

"There are gusty winds and thunderstorms predicted. We are at the mercy of the
weather."

With the hotter conditions the humidity goes down, Paplawski explained.

"They are working hard with helicopter suppression and the Alberta air tankers
are working throughout the Cariboo Fire Centre."

Similar to the message fire information officer Noelle Kekula shared with the
Tribune Tuesday about the wildfires burning west of the Fraser River, Paplawski
said the Wildwood Williams Lake Airport, White Lake and Spokin Lake wildfires
will continue to burn for months to come.

"These fires are complicated," she said. "There are so many values at risk such
as homes, structures, ranches and power lines."

Wildwood/Williams Lake Airport wildfire

The latest update for the Wildwood Williams Airport fire estimates its size to
be 12,987 hectares.

There are 148 firefighters, 47 pieces of heavy equipment and air support working
on the fire Thursday.

"There is lots of work to be done around the perimeter and some tricky spots,"
Paplawski said.

Spokin Lake wildfire

The Spokin Lake wildfire has grown to 3,731 hectares as a result of burnoffs
this week and growth of the fire, she added.

Today there are 99 firefighters, 26 pieces of heavy equipment and air support on
the fire.

"It's a busy one. We have to watch it from all sides," Paplwaski said, noting as
of first thing Thursday morning she had not heard of any gusty winds and
temperatures causing flare ups overnight.

White Lake wildfire

On the White Lake wildfire east of the Fraser River there are 82 firefighters
and 28 pieces of heavy equipment supported by aircraft Thursday.

At present the BC Wildfire Update on the website notes the fire is an estimated
4,228 hectares but that is because between Paplawski and fire information
officer Noelle Kekula they planned to divide the fire's reporting in half.
Kekula would do west of the Fraser River and Paplawski would do the east side.

However, on Thursday morning Paplawski said they may go back to just reporting
both sides as one again so the information will probably be updated later today.

While there hasn't been any planned large burnouts on the White Lake fire,
Paplawski said crews have done some small ones.

Crews working on the west side of the White Lake wildfire worked Tuesday and
Wednesday consolidating the control line from the Fraser River west to Buckskin
Lake, Kekula told the Tribune late Wednesday.

Hanceville-Riske Creek wildfire

Kekula said crews have been conducting burnouts north of the 900 Road on the
west perimeter of the Hanceville-Riske Creek fire and will continue weather
permitting.

"They have also done some successful burnouts on the south flank around Fletcher
Lake," Kekula said. "Today (Wednesday) we have 45 First Nations firefighters
from Anaham and Stone out there doing mop up. It's great to have them helping
us."

The size of the fire is still an estimated 132,000 hectares.

A new fire information officer, Rolf Poole from Australia, is responsible for
updating information on the fires in the West Chilcotin, she added.

"It is hard for him to have access to the phone out there at Puntzi where he is
stationed so he is sending me the updates and I am posting the information on
our website," Kekula said.

She was hoping to get out to Puntzi on Tuesday, but has not yet.

Chezacut wildfire

According to the wildfires of note, the Chezacut wildfire is 10,194 hectares.
There are no numbers on resources, however, no structures are under immediate
threat and ground crews supported by heavy machinery and aircraft continue to
work on containment, including a retardant line.

Kleena Kleene wildfire

Still 5,318 hectares, the Kleena Kleene wildfire continues to be supported by
firefighters, local heavy equipment operators and aircraft.

During the last few days crews took advantage of recent cooler conditions and
made solid progress. Dozers have been building containment guards on the
northwest side of the fire.

"We are still putting dozer guard in at the head of the Colwell Lake fire,
southwest of the Kleena Kleene fire. Crews and aircraft have been targeting
smoking hot spots that remain in the interior of the burnt are," the wildfires
of note update noted.

Maine firefighters help in South;
Rangers have served in Georgia, Texas, Florida, NC; some may go to Arizona

BYLINE: JEN LYNDS BDN STAFF

SECTION: Pg. B1

LENGTH: 771 words


ISLAND FALLS -- On the Fourth of July, many people will be thinking about the
thrill of seeing fireworks exploding in the sky. Across the nation's
drought-stricken South, however, many counties are banning fireworks because of
the risk of wildfires.

It is something that Maine Forest Service Forest Ranger George Harris knows a
lot about. He is one of a number of rangers from the Forest Service who have
been dispatched to states such as Georgia, Texas and North Carolina to fight
several major wildfires.

Crews have been dispatched since April to assist in fighting major wildfires in
Texas, Georgia, North Carolina and Florida. In Florida, wildfires this year have
blackened more than 390 square miles and killed two firefighters.

Parts of nearly a dozen states, from the Southeast to the West, are in a severe
drought. And wildfires have charred thousands of square miles in recent months.

Governor Paul LePage commended forest rangers late last month who had been
deployed to states to help fight several major wildfires around the country.

Harris, a longtime ranger in Aroostook County, spent 17 days in Georgia with
District Ranger Lance Martin, working to contain the Race Pond wildfire in
southeast Georgia.

The two spent close to three days driving a fire engine to Georgia. The Race
Pond fire burned close to 8,000 acres by the time it was contained in mid-June.
The nearby Honey Prairie wildfire had burned close to 300,000 acres by July 3.
It was 70 percent contained by Sunday, according to a website that tracks
wildfires.

Harris said that he and other crews worked 14 hours a day fighting the Race Pond
wildfire and providing support and suppression.

"When we left, it was in the mop-up stages," he said late last week. "But fire
there lays dormant underground and can be hard to fully extinguish. It is really
an ongoing effort to make sure it is fully suppressed."

When they travel to other states, Maine crews serve primarily in leadership
positions that make use of their extensive firefighting experience. They are
mobilized at the request and expense of the federal and state governments,
according to MFS officials. This is the first time that the Forest Service has
sent specialized brush trucks to assist in fighting the blazes.

"I am very proud that our Maine Forest Service forest rangers can go to the
assistance of our sister states to help fight these terrible fires that threaten
human lives and property," LePage said in a written statement. "Not only do they
make use of their superb, nationally recognized firefighting skills, but they
also extend their training and build up reciprocity in case Maine ever needs to
call for similar aid."

"All of these mobilizations help our forest rangers maintain their national
qualifications for managing large incidents, whether they are wildfires,
hurricanes or other natural disasters," Bill Williams, MFS chief forest ranger,
said. "They gain valuable experience and come back better prepared to handle
large incidents in Maine."

Harris has extensive wildfire fighting experience, having fought fires in Texas,
Wyoming and a number of other states.

The governor's office said that the Forest Service is anticipating sending fire
crews to Arizona to fight a devastating wildfire that is raging through that
state.

Due to excessive rain in May, the number of wildfires in Maine is below average,
according to the MFS. To date, the state has experienced only 153 wildfires that
have burned no more than 66 acres. Last year during the same time period, MFS
forest rangers responded to and investigated 338 fires that had burned 234
acres.

So far, nine MFS forest rangers and one ranger pilot have been sent to help with
the wildfires in Texas, Georgia, Florida and North Carolina.

The MFS forest rangers working on the truck crews are limited to two weeks of
out-of-state fire duty. If the fires persist, the crews generally are replaced
by other forest rangers when their two weeks expire.

Should wildfires occur in Maine, the state is not left unprotected by the
absence of the brush trucks, Bill Williams emphasized. The MFS will augment
state-owned forest fire suppression vehicles with federal excess property trucks
to fight any Maine fires, he said.

Harris said that he anticipates being called to fight additional out-of-state
fires as the summer progresses.

"There are a number of states that are very dry for this time of year," he said.
"It is very easy for fires to start there, whether it is by someone carelessly
tossing a cigarette into dry brush or by a lightning strike. It takes a lot of
work to put them out."

PG&E Joins CAL FIRE in Urging Residents to Prevent, Prepare for Wildfires;
PG&E Providing $590,000 in Funding for Butte, Yuba, Lassen, Trinity Counties

BYLINE: The Gridley Herald staff

LENGTH: 582  words


In response to one of the most severe droughts on record, Pacific Gas and
Electric Company (PG&E) announced it is providing nearly $2 million in funding
to local Fire Safe Councils across its service area for fuel reduction projects
and public education to help prevent dangerous wildfires. In the North Valley,
PG&E is providing $590,000 to entities that help prevent wild fires in Butte,
Yuba, Lassen and Trinity counties.

PG&E is also joining CAL FIRE during California Wildfire Awareness Week in
urging residents to prevent and prepare for wildfires. Wildfire Awareness Week'
is observed every year during the first week of May.

With the early-April snowpack water content standing at only five percent of
normal, most of California is at risk for devastating wildfires. That's why PG&E
is supporting CAL FIRE's public education campaigns, "One Less Spark, One Less
Wildfire" and Ready, Set, Go."

"At PG&E, we pride ourselves on being the public's partner in safety. We are
honored to team with firefighters on the important work they do to help educate
Californians about the dangers of wildfires and how to prevent and prepare for
them. We encourage all of our customers and employees to focus on fire safety
now and throughout the entire year," said Barry Anderson, vice president of
emergency preparedness and operations for PG&E.

"California's wildfire activity has been well above normal all year long and as
we reach the traditional summer months that trend is not likely to go away,"
said Daniel Berlant, CAL FIRE chief of public information. "That's why it is
critical that all residents are prepared for wildfires by maintaining 100 feet
of Defensible Space around their homes, and that all Californians take steps to
prevent sparking a wildfire."

This year, North Valley fire safe councils and agencies are receiving funding to
aid chipper programs and do forest fuel reductions. PG&E is contributing
$150,000 to the Butte County Fire Safe Council, $190,000 to the Lassen County
Fire Safe Council, $100,000 to the Trinity County Resource Conservation District
and $150,000 to the Yuba County department of public works.

In 2014, PG&E worked with 38 local Fire Safe Councils to fund fire breaks in and
around communities, improve emergency access roads and help low-income resident
clear defensible space around their properties to protect them from fire. PG&E
is proud to continue working closely with local Fire Safe Councils across
northern and central California to ensure that the communities it serves are
prepared for wildfires.

Since the beginning of this year, CAL FIRE already has responded to more than
1,000 wildfires scorching more than 4,100 acres. That's twice as many than in an
average year. Last year, CAL FIRE responded to 5,600 fires which burned 90,000
acres. According to CAL FIRE, more than 90 percent of all wildfires in
California are sparked by people. PG&E is urging its employees and customers to
use caution when operating outdoor equipment, burning debris or campfires, and
to properly maintain and tow vehicles safely. PG&E will help spread the "One
Less Spark, One Less Wildfire" message on its customer billing envelopes this
summer.

In addition to its already extensive vegetation management program, PG&E is
conducting additional aerial and ground inspections around its power lines to
help ensure that trees or limbs do not come into contact with equipment. The
utility is deploying hundreds of tree workers to mitigate fire risks across its
service area.

Mar. 9--Crunching leaves under one's feet may be a good reminder that it
wouldn't take much for a small debris fire to explode into a raging wildfire.

March has been proclaimed as Wildfire Prevention Month, and local officials said
the timing is perfect. Conditions in Jones County are extremely favorable for
fires getting out of control because of a lack of rainfall, low humidity, and
gusting winds.

Jones County Fire Coordinator Dan McKenna said the county is 42-percent below
normal on rainfall already this year. Over the past few weeks, he said,
wildfires have already resulted in the loss of several structures and dozens of
acres.

Jimmy Mordica, director of conservation education and public outreach for the
Mississippi Forestry Commission, said March is traditionally the worst month for
wildfires because there are still a lot of leaves and brush on the ground from
the fall and winter and nothing is there to stop flames from spreading.

"Nothing has greened up yet," Mordica said. "These warm days give people Spring
fever and their clearing fence rows, pond dams, gardens, their yards."

Wildfires that stay on the person's own property are taken care of by fire
departments and the Mississippi Forestry Commission.

"If they start a wildfire and it stays on their property, forestry will fight it
for no charge. That's part of their property taxes."

But, he said, if the wildfire spreads to a neighboring property, the person who
set the fire can be held liable for damage to timber, buildings, and even
houses. Mordica said that happened last year near the Jones -- Forrest County
line when a wildfire burned 40 acres of pines and a house.

Mordica said people should not burn anything on windy days. He also offered the
following tips:

--Clear flammable vegetation up to 30 feet away from your house. You can leave
some trees as long as their branches are 10 feet apart from other trees.

--Eliminate ladder fuels by mowing tall grass, trimming shrubs, and pruning
lower branches as described above.

--Keep the lawn watered and mowed short (3 inches or less) on all sides of all
buildings.

Clean the roof, gutters, and windowsills of leaves, needles, and other debris.

Rep. Bishop: Wildfire budget plan 'missed opportunity'

BYLINE: By Matthew Daly - Associated Press For the Deseret News

LENGTH: 703 words


By Matthew Daly

Associated Press

WASHINGTON - Last week's spending bill includes a bipartisan plan to create a
wildfire disaster fund to help combat increasingly severe wildfires that have
devastated the West in recent years.

The bill sets aside more than $20 billion over 10 years to allow the Forest
Service and other federal agencies end a practice of raiding nonfire-related
accounts to pay for wildfire costs, which approached $3 billion last year.

But Utah Congressman Rob Bishop slammed the wildfire measure as a missed
opportunity. The bill "slightly improves the Forest Service's flexibility," but
it "does very little to restore the health of our nation's forests," said
Bishop, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee.

"Democrats, especially in the Senate, stood in the way of forest reform that
could have prevented future catastrophic wildfires," said Bishop, a Republican
who supports a House-passed bill that calls for faster approval of logging
projects to reduce the risk of fire in national forests.

"We are not looking forward to the Schumer fires of 2018," Bishop said,
referring to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, who played a
key role in the spending bill.

President Donald Trump signed the measure Friday.

Western lawmakers have long complained that the current funding mechanism - tied
to a 10-year average for wildfires - makes budgeting difficult, even as fires
burn longer and hotter each year.

The new plan sets aside $2 billion per year - outside the regular budget - so
officials don't have to tap money meant for prevention programs to fight
wildfires.

"Common sense has finally prevailed when it comes to how the Forest Service pays
to fight record-breaking forest fires that devastate homes and communities in
Oregon and the West," said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who helped broker the deal
with Sens. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. GOP Reps. Mike
Simpson of Idaho and Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington also played key roles,
along with other lawmakers from both parties.

The Western lawmakers have been fighting for years to end "fire borrowing," a
practice they say devastates rational budgeting for the Forest Service and other
agencies.

"This long-overdue, bipartisan solution to the madness of 'fire borrowing' will
at last treat these infernos like the natural disasters they are, with the
benefit that millions of dollars will now be liberated each year for essential
wildfire prevention," Wyden said in a statement.

The wildfire deal "puts an end to fire-borrowing and is a start to giving the
Forest Service the predictable resources they need to reduce hazardous fuels"
such as small trees and underbrush that exacerbate wildfires, Cantwell said.

"This funding boost will allow the Forest Service to prioritize work in areas
closest to communities, in order to save lives and reduce the risk of property
damage, while still protecting essential public lands and existing environmental
laws," said Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee.

The measure establishes a contingency account through 2027, with annual deposits
starting at $2.1 billion and increasing to $2.9 billion. Money from the account
would only be used after funds from usual firefighting accounts are exhausted.

Wildfires have burned across dried-out Western forests and grassland in recent
years, causing billions of dollars in damage. The Forest Service and Interior
Department spent more than $2.7 billion last year fighting fires - the most
expensive wildfire season on record.

The budget deal includes $100 million for fire prevention projects and
recreation programs and enables utilities to work with the Forest Service to
prevent trees from touching power lines and starting wildfires.

Simpson, a senior member of the House appropriations panel, called the wildfire
fund one of his most significant accomplishments in nearly two decades in
Congress.

"It is long past due that wildfires in the West receive equal treatment with
other natural disasters, and this bill delivers the necessary budget changes to
stop the dangerous practice of fire borrowing that has led to catastrophic
wildfires in Idaho and throughout the West," he said.

Islanders urged to be help combat wildfires

LENGTH: 585  words


Scottish Fire and Rescue Service's (SFRS) Local Senior Officer (LSO) for Western
Isles, Shetland and Orkney is urging communities to Join Scotland's Fight
Against Fire and help Scottish Fire and Rescue Service reduce wildfire incidents
on the islands.

Last year firefighters were called to deal with hundreds of wildfire/grassfire
incidents across Scotland, and the demand on SFRS resources was significant. It
is hoped that an awareness raising campaign will help reduce that demand.

SFRS say we are now entering that time of year when the risk of wildfire is at
its highest and SFRS is keen to work with land managers, tourists and
communities to help cut the number fires in a bid to protect the countryside and
its residents.

Local Senior Officer for Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney, Billy Wilson, said:
"Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is urging people to Join Scotland's Fight
Against Fire and we are asking communities, tourists and visitors to be aware of
the heightened risk of wildfire at this time of year.

"We want people to act responsibly in a countryside environment, such as
properly disposing of smoking materials to prevent these fires happening in the
first place. We had a number of large wildfires last year which affected areas
of the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland."

LSO Wilson added: "We are also speaking to land managers and asking that they do
not burn out with the permitted season and ensure suitable fire plans' are in
place during land management operations.

"When wildfires occur they impact greatly on rural areas and can cause
substantial environmental and economic damage. Wildfires also pose a threat to
communities and by raising awareness we are aiming to reduce the risk."

There are a number of things land managers can do to help prevent wildfires,
including strict adherence to the Muirburn Code, which applies to the controlled
burning of heather within the permitted season.

The fire service has historically worked with land managers to provide advice
around their fire plans in an attempt to reduce the number of wildfires and that
work will continue.

LSO Wilson added: "The assistance of local land owners and managers, as well as
members of the public, was very much appreciated last year. In particular I
would like to thank local employers who released our retained and community
response crew members to deal with these incidents. Their continued support is
key to maintaining the safety of our local communities."

Many wildland fires are started deliberately or are due to careless, reckless or
irresponsible behaviour. If you see someone acting suspiciously, recklessly or
irresponsibly in the countryside contact Police Scotland on 101 or pass
information anonymously to Scotland Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Scottish Wildfire Project Manager, Garry Burnett, said: "I am very much focused
on delivering a preventative agenda within the wildfire environment. The
reduction in wildfire incidents will not only benefit public safety but will
reduce significant demand on our firefighting personnel.

"As the first Scottish Wildfire Project Manager, I am determined to reduce this
type of incident utilising strong external and internal partnerrelationships and
relying on those collaborations to reduce risk."

The website also has a link to the Muirburn Code and there is more advice in the
Scottish Outdoor Access Code.

West Coast Soccer

Girls U16

The West Coast Wildfire U16 girls soccer team played to impress in Las Vegas
Players Showcase this past weekend. The team battled teams from Arizona,
Southern Cal, Utah, and Washington in front of college coaches from around the
country.

In their first match Wildfire won by forfeit of a Texas team, and in their
second match the Wildfire faced LaRoca-Utah, who came out firing and scoring two
quick goals in the first half. The Wildfire quickly rallied with a goal on
penalty kick by Meghan Giamona. Thier second goal came from a set piece by Tori
Diehl, who nailed her shot into the top left corner from 40-yards out. Jasmyne
Dunn broke through with the third goal to put the Wildfire ahead, and shortly
after Giamona added an insurance goal, as the Wildfire defense held on to the
two-goal lead and secured the win.

In the third match of the showcase, the Wildfire fell behind 1-0 to a tough
Washington squad. But, once again the Wildfire rallied in the second half but
despite heavy pressure and multiple attempts they couldn't find the net as time
expired on a 1-0 Washington win.

In the fourth and final game of the weekend, the Wildfire shutdown Arizona's
state champions, 1-0. The Wildfire dominated all facets of the match, from
possession, crisp passing, impenetrable defensive, and a continuous barrage of
shots on goal. The lone goal came of a cross by Isabella Barbero, into the box
where Sierra Martin put a head on the ball and found the net past the Arizona
keeper.

This is the third consecutive year the WCS Wildfire have participated in the
Players Showcase Las Vegas. The team will next set their sights on the NorCal
Premier League and the California Regional League state cup finals.

Upcoming recruitable group tryouts will be held on April 1. For more information

Idaho: Wyden, Risch, Merkley, Heinrich Urge Congress to Pass Bipartisan Wildfire
Funding Fix in Senate Bill

LENGTH: 370  words



Boise: The Senate Office of James e. Risch of Idaho has issued the following
news release:
As wildfire season rages across Oregon, Idaho and the West, Sens. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore., Jim Risch, R-Idaho, Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Martin Heinrich, D-N.M.,
yesterday urged the Senate to pass a wildfire funding fix included in new
legislation to address funding for floods and other natural disasters.


A wildfire funding fix similar to the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which Wyden
and Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, first introduced in 2013, was included in July in
legislation under consideration by the Senate Banking Committee to reauthorize
the National Flood Insurance Program.
Just like the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, the wildfire funding fix included
in the new legislation would end the cycle of underfunding fire suppression that
currently forces federal agencies to steal from fire prevention to fight fires.

"Over the years, we have worked to fix fire borrowing in any way we could find,"
Wyden, Risch, Merkley and Heinrich wrote in a letter to Crapo and Sen. Sherrod
Brown, D-Ohio, on the Senate Banking Committee. "Yet year after year, fire
season after fire season, the fires continue to worsen and any attempt at a fix
gets snarled in Washington politics."
"Along with the reauthorization of these flood and disaster programs, the
Committee also included a provision of great interest to us - a wildfire funding
fix. We write to strongly urge you to ensure this provision remains in the final
bill as it is considered by the Committee and in the full Senate."
The language included in the Senate flood mitigation bill from the Wildfire
Disaster Funding Act would end "fire borrowing" by funding the largest wildfires
from a similar disaster account used to fund other natural disasters.
According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the risk of flooding after
wildfires is"significantly higher" for up to five years after a wildfire. Fires
increase the risk of floods and flash flooding by wiping out trees, shrubs and
other plants that allow soil to absorb rainfall and snowmelt.

AIG Teams with Montecito Fire Officials to Prep Key Areas for Height of Wildfire
Season; Marks 10 Years of AIG's Wildfire Protection Unit

LENGTH: 366  words


Sept. 15 -- AIG Private Client Group, a division of American International
Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) that serves high net worth clients, today marked the
10-year anniversary of its Wildfire Protection Unit (WPU) with Montecito, CA,
officials, providing pro-bono fire protection to key areas in the Montecito Fire
Protection District in preparation for the height of wildfire season.

AIG's WPU, in collaboration with Montecito wildfire specialists, spent the day
spraying a bio-degradable fire retardant and performing other mitigation actions
in the Montecito area using special-purpose built AIG WPU trucks.

The work in Montecito recognizes the vulnerability of California to wildfires.
In 2014, 7,865 fires destroyed 555,044 acres and caused millions in property
damage statewide, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. And the
2015 wildfire season has been very active.

AIG's WPU was created ten years ago to serve AIG Private Client Group clients in
select areas of Northern and Southern California. The service has been expanded
to include additional customers in California, as well as in parts of Colorado
and Texas. The AIG WPU is not a private fire department, but a loss mitigation
service designed to preempt damage well before a wildfire ignites.

Throughout the year, AIG's certified wildfire specialists, in custom-built WPU
trucks, visit homeowners to educate them about bolstering their home's fire
defenses throughout the dry season. They work in collaboration with local fire
authorities and, when warranted, spray fire retardant around the perimeters of
vulnerable properties as an added layer of wildfire protection. The type of fire
retardant used remains effective on ground vegetation for months, or until
washed off with a hose or heavy rain.

"The Wildfire Protection Unit puts in action AIG's philosophy of working
strategically with our customers to reduce risk. Helping homeowners mitigate the
risk of wildfires destroying or damaging their homes, particularly in fire-prone
areas, helps protect property and people and is a service we take great pride in
providing," says Kevin Hogan, Chief Executive Officer, AIG Consumer Insurance.

Fire department organizes wildfire community preparedness session

Dec. 12--NORMAN -- The Norman Fire Department, along with Oklahoma Forestry
Services, has organized a community preparedness meeting this week to help
prepare Normanites in case of a wildfire.

"We're excited for an opportunity to educate Norman residents on wildfires, and
what they can do to ensure their safety, as well as the safety of their homes,"
Norman Fire Dept. Chief Travis King said.

The information session will be from 1 to 3 p.m. Saturday at Station No. 9, 3001
Alameda St.

There will be presentations preparing homeowners in an event of a wildfire, as
well as information on an upcoming prescribed burn set for east Norman.

"It's a very proactive approach; we want people to leave more fire-wise,"
Oklahoma Forestry Services spokesperson Drew Daily said. "Some of the things we
are going to talk about are some no-cost things homeowners can do to improve
their homes' probability for surviving a wildfire, as well as some general tips
on home maintenance."

King said the timing is appropriate because the state is experiencing dryer
conditions and could experience some wildfires in the near future.

"We are starting to see the fuels and the grasses going dormant," he said. "When
they go dormant, fuel moistures are lower, which makes them more susceptible to
ignition."

King said February to April is prime time for wildfires, but they can happen any
time.

In addition to the discussion on homeowner wildfire preparedness, the forestry
service will educate attendees about its plan to utilize a prescribed fire near
Lake Thunderbird in January or February, as well as future plans to utilize
prescribed fires.

"The land out there is in need of being properly managed," Daily said. "To do
that is our plan to introduce prescribed fires to the area, specifically for two
purposes: to reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfire and to improve the
ecology of the habit in the area around the lake."

Daily said the idea to use prescribed fires as a way to reduce the impact of
wildfire occurrences, came from the devastation the 2012 Cleveland County fires
caused.

"We are looking to utilize prescribed fires to lessen the chances of seeing the
damaging effects that fire caused," he said.

The series of fires Daily is referring to lasted for weeks.

One woman lost her life and several homes and many buildings were lost,
including 58 homes and an estimated 4,500 to 7,000 acres in Norman city limits.

Call for north communities to help prevent wildfires

BYLINE: Ashleigh Barbour

SECTION: NEWS; OTHER; Others; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 336 words


Communities across the north have been urged to play their part in keeping the
countryside safe as wildfire season approaches.

The new chairman of the Scottish Wildfire Forum (SWF), Andy Coueslant, said it
was everyone's responsibility to protect where they live from potentially
devastating blazes as demand on the fire service begins to increase.

Mr Coueslant - deputy assistant chief officer of the Scottish Fire and Rescue
Service - recently took over as leader of the organisation, and yesterday said
he was committed to ensuring that the rate of open air blazes continues to fall
- in 2014 there was a 61% reduction in wildfires across Scotland, saving
£278,000.

With many blazes started deliberately due to "careless, reckless or
irresponsible behaviour", he said, it is essential that every precaution is
taken.

"As we are now entering what has historically been seen as wildfire season I am
keen to stress that everyone has a responsibility to protect our countryside,
people and property for the devastating effects of wildfire," he said.

"We want people to Join Scotland's Fight Against Fire and we are urging
communities, tourists and visitors to be aware of the heightened risk of
wildfire at this time of year."

Mr Coueslant said there were a number of "proactive" steps land owners could
take to help prevent wildfires, including strict adherence to the Muirburn Code,
which applies to the controlled burning of heather.

He said it was also essential to properly dispose of smoking materials to
prevent fires happening in the first place.

"When wildfires occur they have a serious impact on rural and remote areas of
Scotland and have the potential to cause significant environmental and economic
damage," he said.

"It is important we all do what we can to protect farmland and wildlife,
protected woodland and Sites of Special Scientific Interest, buildings, property
and the lives of those who live in rural communities."

Washington: Bennet, Gardner Introduce Bill to Permanently Fix Wildfire Funding

LENGTH: 549  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Michael Bennet, U.S Government has issued the
following news release:
Colorado U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D) and Cory Gardner (R) introduced an
updated version of their bipartisan wildfire funding solution that would provide
desperately needed funding for fire prevention.


"Catastrophic wildfires continue to plague the West, not only threatening
communities and livelihoods but also draining the Forest Service budget," Bennet
said. "We need to restructure the way we pay for fighting catastrophic fires to
mitigate and prevent future wildfires. This bill would end the practice of fire
borrowing-a necessary step that will enable the Forest Service to make
responsible investments on the front end to restore our forests and safeguard
our watersheds."
"It may not be getting headlines in the national news, but wildfires have burned
millions of acres in the West this year and the communities impacted in Colorado
need assistance," Gardner said. "I've been working to advance this legislation
to stop fire borrowing for several years, and I appreciate the strong bipartisan
support to ensure the Forest Service has the funds it needs for clean-up and
prevention efforts while also finally requiring the government to treat
wildfires like it does other natural disasters."
Unlike for other natural disasters, where agencies can draw from an emergency
fund to pay for disaster response, the U.S. Forest Service and Interior
Department do not have access to disaster funds and are forced to "fire borrow"
- or steal money from fire prevention and other important programs already
funded in their agencies to pay to put out fires. The Wildfire Disaster Funding
Act of 2017 would end the destructive cycle of fire borrowing and stop the
erosion of the Forest Service's budget by reforming the way the federal
government funds wildfires.
Currently, federal agencies calculate wildfire suppression budgets based on the
average costs of wildfire suppression over the past 10 years. But as fire
seasons grow longer and wildfires become more expensive to fight, Congress is
forced to appropriate more funding to an outdated budgeting system that almost
always underestimates the actual cost of fighting fires.
This legislation would fund wildfires as natural disasters and protect the
agencies' fire prevention budget by putting a freeze on the rising budget costs
of the 10-year average. It would make funding available after the appropriated
fire suppression funds are spent, allowing the Forest Service to use its fire
prevention funding for its intended purpose - completing hazardous fuels
reduction projects that have been shown to help break the cycle of increasingly
dangerous and costly fires.
Earlier this month, Bennet sent a letter with a bipartisan group of Senators to
Senate Leaders Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Charles Schumer (D-NY) urging them to
include a wildfire funding fix in any future disaster aid legislation that
passes through Congress. Gardner has also directly spoken with McConnell about
the wildfire funding fix.
In addition to Bennet and Gardner, the bill is cosponsored by Senators Ron Wyden
(D-OR), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Jim Risch (R-ID), Maria
Cantwell (D-WA), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR).

Washington: Bennet Highlights Dysfunction of Wildfire Funding at Agriculture
Committee Hearing

LENGTH: 689  words



    Washington: Office of the Senator Michael Bennet, U.S Government has issued
the following news release:



 Today, Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet discussed the threat of wildfire
and the dysfunctional way wildfire suppression is funded, including the negative
effects of "fire borrowing," at a hearing in the Senate Committee on
Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. At the hearing, entitled "Wildfire:
Stakeholder Perspectives on Budgetary Impacts and Threats to Natural Resources
on Federal, State and Private Lands," Chris Treese of the Colorado River Water
Conservation District discussed the problem of fire borrowing and the long-term
effects of catastrophic wildfires.





 During the hearing Bennet said:



 "What comes through to me is that there is a compelling consensus that what we
are doing now does not work and that we have got to change and it's long
overdue... In the name of fiscal responsibility we are managing our forests in
the most fiscally irresponsible way we can manage them. Which is to say we are
taking the money that could be spent on mitigation and restoration, and we're
using it to suppress fires and then there's no money left to mitigate or
restore. It's penny wise and pound foolish. Nobody at the local level would
accept this way of managing their resources, and we shouldn't accept it either."

 Wildfire is a growing threat throughout the west and the cost of fighting
wildfires and the resulting fire borrowing is one of the biggest problems facing
the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). Wildfire spending has more than doubled since
the 1990s, climbing from $1.6 billion in 1994 to $3.9 billion in 2014. In seven
of the past ten years, the USFS has exceeded its budget for wildfire
suppression, requiring the Agency to conduct fire borrowing to cover suppression
costs. The borrowed funds come from accounts that should be used for hazardous
fuels treatment and other forest management activities. Bennet is co-sponsoring
the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act to fund wildfires like other natural disasters
through a separate disaster funding cap.



 In May of this year, Bennet invited Senator Cory Gardner to join him at a Fire
and Forestry Summit to receive recommendations from a report Bennet previously
commissioned on steps the federal government can take to better support
Colorado's wildfire mitigation efforts. Bennet and Gardner heard from Colorado
experts in forestry and fire mitigation to discuss their real-world experiences
working in Colorado forests and communities. The recommendations were then send
to USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack. Bennet also included many of the recommendations
in the revised PREPARE Act he reintroduced with Senator Mike Crapo in August to
provide targeted investments for wildfire mitigation.



 During the Senate's consideration of the 2014 Farm Bill, Bennet secured several
provisions to address wildfire mitigation and suppression efforts, including one
to extend Good Neighbor authority to all states. Yesterday, the U.S. Forest
Service (USFS) announced that they finalized a Good Neighbor Authority agreement
with the Colorado State Forest Service (CSFS). The collaborative agreement will
create a federal-state partnership that will leverage state resources to protect
water supplies, manage bark beetle, reduce wildfire, and other forest management
activities.



 Bennet also successfully passed several other measures as a part of the Farm
Bill to improve forest health and reduce fuel loads to mitigate the cost and
damage of wildfires. These include stewardship contracting which supports
public-private partnerships to maintain national forests and streamlining the
treatment of beetle-killed forests by designating new national forest acreages
for expedited treatments. The USFS has currently designated approximately 46.7
million acres of National Forest System lands across 36 states as potentially
eligible for expedited treatment, and two fast-tracked projects are currently
underway in Colorado.

B.C. failed to reduce wildfire risk: communities

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 924 words


The fire in Logan Lake started like so many others in B.C.'s worst wildfire
season on record - a smouldering campfire, not fully extinguished, sparked
flames that spread across the forest floor.

But unlike other blazes that have grown catastrophically, engulfing homes,
forests and farmland, the Logan Lake fire in June was kept to a half-hectare.
The reason, a local official says, is because the town has conducted extensive
wildfire mitigation, in spite of a provincial system he describes as
under-funded, burdensome and unfair.

"Had (the fire) been in that area when we did not mitigate that area, we
would've had a severe fire on our hands," said Fire Chief Dan Leighton. "That's
proof that the work we're doing will work."

In the wake of the 2003 wildfire crisis, which destroyed more than 300 homes and
businesses, the British Columbia government asked former Manitoba premier Gary
Filmon to conduct a thorough review. In his report, Firestorm 2003 , he warned
that unless action was taken to reduce fuels such as seedlings, shrubs and wood
debris in forests near communities, there would be more severe wildfires.

The province launched the strategic wildfire prevention initiative, a program
that provides funding to communities for fuel treatment. To date, the province
has provided $78 million to the initiative, a fraction of the amount spent
battling blazes or preparing for earthquakes, and less than seven per cent of
high-risk land has been treated.

This summer, the wildfire season surpassed 2003, burning 10,600 square
kilometres of land and forcing 45,000 people from their homes. The bill is $400
million and rising. The devastation has left community leaders and experts
saying the province could have done more to reduce the risk.

"The amount of fuel management to protect communities was minuscule relative to
the scale of the challenge," said Bob Simpson, Quesnel mayor and a former NDP
forestry critic in the legislature.

The province estimates about 13,470 square kilometres of forest are at high risk
of wildfires spreading into communities. The figure is considered rough,
provincial-level data and must be verified on the ground, but it's the best
estimate available. Some 923 square kilometres have undergone fuel treatment -
or just under seven per cent.

John Rustad, the forests minister prior to the B.C. Liberal government's defeat
in July after 16 years in power, said the government worked seriously with
communities to reduce fuel loads. The province expanded the community forest
program, which allows towns to harvest nearby timberlands and make them more
fire-resistant, he said.

Unfortunately, the mountain pine beetle epidemic has led to fuel buildup even in
places where work was done a decade ago, he said, adding treatment is costly and
must be done continuously.

"Could we have spent more? Obviously, hindsight is 20/20," he said. "But when
you look at the fires that came in toward Cache Creek or Ashcroft, I don't think
there would have been any strategy possible to prevent that kind of an interface
(fire) and those kinds of damages."

Madeline Maley, executive director of the B.C. Wildfire Service, said managing
wildfire risk is a shared responsibility and the province counts on local
governments and homeowners to meet the standards of a program called FireSmart.

The Forest Practices Board estimated in 2015 that the average cost of treating a
hectare of land was $10,000, although some experts put the figure at $5,000.
That means the lowest cost of treating 13,470 square kilometres would be $6.7
billion. The board said the cost per hectare could be reduced through increased
competition and incentives.

In Logan Lake, careful removal of so-called ladder fuels, including tall
grasses, shrubs and branches, is what kept the wildfire in June from growing
upward and becoming what's known as a crown fire, which leaps from treetop to
treetop and is much harder to contain.

But Leighton, the fire chief, said his frustrations with the strategic wildfire
initiative are growing. Communities are required to do the work at considerable
cost before being reimbursed, he said, adding it can take up to a year to
receive funds.

Then there's the fact that the land they are treating is Crown land surrounding
the municipality, but the province only pays for 75 per cent of the planning and
90 per cent of the treatment, he said.

"The province should be paying 100 per cent," said Leighton.

Paul Taylor, a spokesman for the Union of B.C. Municipalities, said if the
up-front cost is prohibitive for communities, they can ask to submit regular
claims to receive payments throughout the process.

The B.C. government created a forest enhancement society last year that has
received $235 million for activities including wildfire risk reduction, bringing
the total spent on mitigation, when combined with the strategic wildfire
initiative, to $313 million.

In contrast, it has spent billions preparing for a major earthquake - a worthy
use of funds, but one expert wonders why wildfires have not been made an equal
priority.

"Here we are with wildfires with severe consequences," said Lori Daniels, an
associate professor of forest and conservation sciences at the University of
British Columbia.

And unlike a major earthquake, she said, "It's not if it's going to happen in
our lifetime. It happens every summer in our lifetime."

Fire Safety - Spring Clean-up

BYLINE: The Canistota Clipper staff

LENGTH: 247  words


Wildland fires burning in Colorado are grim warnings that current conditions can
support early wildfires on our landscape. Homeowners, especially those living in
wooded surroundings can do much to improve safety in fire-prone areas.

Wildfires occur regularly in our area and can spread quickly with the right
weather conditions. Homes that are located near the wildland are at risk when a
wildfire burns out of control. A wildfire sees houses as just another fuel
source.

There are several things that homeowners can do to reduce their risk from
catastrophic wildfire: Clean roofs and gutters of flammable material such as
leaves, branches and pine needles. Clear brush, trees and dead vegetation for a
30 foot minimum distance from homes. Keep grass mowed or trimmed within 100 feet
of homes. Prune the lower branches of tall trees and remove any dead or dying
limbs.

Local Fire Departments have many concerns during a wildfire, from evacuating
people out of harm's way, to stopping the progression of the wildfire, to
providing for the safety of other firefighters. If your home happens to be in a
wildfire's path, they may or may not be able to protect it. "Homeowners who take
steps to make their homes Firewise are much more likely to have their home
survive when a wildfire occurs," said Tristan Fluharty, Fire Management Officer
for the Nebraska National Forests & Grasslands.

7,000 buildings destroyed in deadly California wildfires

BYLINE:  By JANIE HAR Associated Press

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A10

LENGTH: 339 words


SAN FRANCISCO - California officials have raised the number of homes and
structures destroyed in this month's wildfires to nearly 7,000 and said Thursday
that the number will likely climb as crews continue assessing areas scorched by
the blazes that killed 42 people.

The estimate of homes and structures burned was boosted to 6,900 from 5,700 as
fire crews returned to hard-hit neighborhoods and assessed remote and rural
areas they could not get to earlier, said Daniel Berlant, a spokesman with the
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

He said most of the newly counted destroyed buildings burned on Oct. 8 and Oct.
9 - when the wildfires broke out in Northern California's wine country and other
nearby areas.

"The estimates are in structures and are mostly homes, but also includes
commercial structures and outbuildings like barns and sheds," Berlant said.

Twenty-two of the 42 deaths in California's October fires happened in a Sonoma
County wildfire, making it the third deadliest in California history.

A 1933 Los Angeles fire that killed 29 people was the deadliest, followed by a
1991 fire in Oakland that killed 25.

California Gov. Jerry Brown late Wednesday issued an executive order to speed up
recovery efforts as fire authorities say they've stopped the progress of
wildfires.

Tens of thousands of people have been allowed back home but more than 15,000
people remained evacuated Thursday, down from a high of 100,000 Saturday.

Brown's order also allowed disrupted wineries to relocate tasting rooms and
suspended state fees for mobile home parks and manufactured homes.

The order extends the state's prohibition on price gouging during emergencies
until April 2018 and expedites hiring of personnel for emergency and recovery
operations.

In Los Angeles County, authorities said a charred body was found on Mount
Wilson, where crews were trying to surround a smoldering wildfire in steep
terrain.

California firefighters were also battling a blaze that sent smoke billowing
into the college beach town of Santa Cruz.

Capstone Reports New High Grade Copper-Gold Discovery at Minto Mine

LENGTH: 802  words


Karachi, July 16 -- Capstone Mining Corp. (CS: TSX) today announced assay
results from a new high grade copper-gold discovery, called "Wildfire", at its
Minto Mine. The Wildfire discovery was made as a result of testing of an
extensive geophysical anomaly detected during a deep penetrating IP survey being
conducted over the Minto Mine property. Mineralized intercepts from three
additional step-out holes, similar to the discovery hole, are being prepared for
shipment to the assay lab and a third exploration drill is being sent to the
mine to accelerate the assessment of this new discovery. Highlights from
Wildfire discovery hole 10SWC635 are summarized in the table below, according to
a press release issued here.

Wildfire Discovery - Minto Mine

As reported on June 23, 2010, Capstone is undertaking a property-wide Titan-24
deep penetrating Induced Potential ("IP") survey. The survey is wrapping up this
week but preliminary results identify a number of chargeability anomalies in
areas untested by previous drilling. The Wildfire anomaly is one of the
strongest and most extensive IP anomalies yet identified at Minto. Based upon
the size, strength, and location with respect to known deposits, a decision was
taken to drill Wildfire based upon the preliminary IP data only.

The Wildfire IP chargeability anomaly measures more than 900 metres north-south
by more than 250 metres east-west. Previous drilling at Copper Keel North,
Copper Keel South and at Airstrip, all with good results, had skirted the
perimeter of the recently delineated Wildfire anomaly, but had not tested the
main portion of anomaly. The discovery hole, 10SWC-635 reported herein, and
three subsequent holes completed to date are targeted within the main part of
the anomaly. More drilling is required to determine if mineralization is
continuous between the known mineralization previously identified at Copper Keel
North, Copper Keel South, and Airstrip. Capstone's most recent 3D geology model
for Area 2 suggests continuity between Area 2 and Copper Keel North, and now
geophysics suggests continuity right across to Wildfire and Copper Keel South.
Drill road construction has commenced in order to facilitate a systematic drill
pattern at Wildfire across its entire extent.

The mineralization at Wildfire is principally comprised of chalcocite, along
with lesser bornite, chalcopyrite and native copper. Due to the presence of
coarse native copper, additional screen analysis assays are being conducted to
ensure such material is not being lost in the routine assay approach. Similar
chalcocite-dominated mineralization was defined in the upper mineralized zone at
Ridgetop and returned excellent recoveries and concentrate grades. Metallurgical
testing will be required to determine the metallurgical characteristics of the
Wildfire discovery.

Additional Minto Drilling

In addition to more drilling at Wildfire, drilling at Minto for the remainder of
2010 will also focus on increasing the confidence in and extending deeper
mineral resources at Minto East, Area 2 and Copper Keel, as well as testing
other Titan-24 IP anomalies already identified. Further step out and delineation
drilling will be required in order to fully define the limits of the
mineralization in all areas and to increase confidence levels to a point
sufficient to support a conversion to mineral reserves, if economic factors
warrant, by demonstrating both continuity of grade and thicknesse Published by

Capstone Reports New High Grade Copper-Gold Discovery at Minto Mine

LENGTH: 802  words



Karachi, July 15 -- Capstone Mining Corp. (CS: TSX) today announced assay
results from a new high grade copper-gold discovery, called "Wildfire", at its
Minto Mine. The Wildfire discovery was made as a result of testing of an
extensive geophysical anomaly detected during a deep penetrating IP survey being
conducted over the Minto Mine property. Mineralized intercepts from three
additional step-out holes, similar to the discovery hole, are being prepared for
shipment to the assay lab and a third exploration drill is being sent to the
mine to accelerate the assessment of this new discovery. Highlights from
Wildfire discovery hole 10SWC635 are summarized in the table below, according to
a press release issued here.

Florida: Florida Forest Service Celebrates Smokey Bear's 71st Birthday

LENGTH: 269  words


Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, The state of Florida has issued
the following news release:

This Sunday, Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam H. Putnam and the Florida
Forest Service will celebrate the 71st birthday of Smokey Bear, the national
symbol for wildfire prevention.

"As we continue to fight wildfires in Florida and deploy Florida Forest Service
wildland firefighters to California to help battle their massive wildfires, we
are reminded of the importance of Smokey Bear's fire prevention message," stated
Commissioner of Agriculture Adam H. Putnam

For generations, the Smokey Bear campaign has been the cornerstone for effective
wildfire prevention education. Since 1944, Smokey Bear has been a recognized
symbol for the conservation and protection of America's forests.  Smokey Bear's
message, "Only you can prevent wildfires," has helped to reduce the number of
U.S. acres burned by wildfires from about 22 million to 7 million annually.

Since January, the Florida Forest Service has responded to 2,094 wildfires that
have burned 70,106 acres. More than 70 percent of all wildfires in Florida are
caused by human carelessness and are preventable.

"Smokey Bear's message is as significant today as it was 71 years ago. Careless
wildfires unnecessarily endanger the lives of citizens and wildland firefighters
alike. They also occupy resources that could otherwise be ready to fight
naturally caused wildfires, such as those caused by lightning," said Jim Karels,
Florida State Forester.

Forestry Commission Educates Public on Outdoor Fire Safety - Wildfire Prevention
Month (March)

BYLINE: Mississippi Forestry Commission

LENGTH: 667  words


Jackson, MS,  March 04, 2017 --(PR.com)-- March is Wildfire Prevention Month in
Mississippi as stated by Governor Phil Bryant's proclamation. Historically,
March has one of the highest wildfire occurrence rates of the year due to the
weather transition from winter to spring, dry vegetation, and windy conditions.
Since January 1, 2017, the Mississippi Forestry Commission (MFC) responded to
and suppressed 491 wildfires that burned 9,422 acres. MFC Wildland Firefighters
saved 1,072 homes and structures. Wildfire activity destroyed or damaged 28
homes and structures. Sadly, 2 wildfire-related fatalities were reported.

"Nationwide, 9 out of 10 wildfires are human-caused, which means 9 out of 10
wildfires could have been prevented with proper care. Wildfire prevention month
allows us to highlight the responsibility of Mississippi's citizens to help
protect lives, homes, and forestland by focusing on how to prevent wildfires,"
said Charlie Morgan, State Forester.

Please do your part to help prevent wildfires by following the tips below:

- Check the local weather forecast - do not engage in any outdoor burning on
dry, windy days.

- If the purpose of the burn is agriculture or forestry related, call the MFC
Central Dispatch Center for your area to obtain a burning permit:
http://bit.ly/MFCDispatch

- Always find out if there is a burn ban in your area before doing any outdoor
recreational burning. To see a list of burn bans: http://bit.ly/BurnBans

- Check local laws and city ordinances in your area to make sure outdoor
recreational burning is allowed.

- Choose a safe burn site - the ground around the burn site should be surrounded
by gravel or dirt and clear of vegetation that could catch fire (minimum of 10
feet in all directions).

- Only burn untreated wood debris (waste, plastic, rubber tires, and other
manufactured products may not be burned). To view the Mississippi Department of
Environmental Quality standards regarding outdoor burning, visit:
http://bit.ly/MDEQOpenBurning

- Keep campfires small and never leave an outdoor fire unattended.

- Always have water on hand to put out the fire and stay until it has been
completely extinguished.

- When homes are near wooded areas, prescribed (or controlled) burning can be
utilized responsibly by a Certified Burn Manager to reduce fuel for wildfires.
Prescribed burning clears underbrush and other flammable vegetation that builds
up on the forest floor. A burning permit from the MFC is required for this
activity. To learn more about becoming a Certified Burn Manager:
http://bit.ly/PBS_2017

Make Firewise preparations to help defend your home in the event of a wildfire.
The Firewise program equips homeowners and community leaders with the
information they need to help design, construct, landscape, and maintain homes
and communities to better withstand wildfires. To learn more about how to have a
Firewise home: http://bit.ly/Firewise

To report a wildfire, dial 911 or call the Central Dispatch Center for your
area:

Northwest Region: 1-877-226-5414

Northeast Region: 1-800-681-8760

Southwest Region: 1-888-823-3473

South Central Region: 1-800-736-9115

Southeast Region: 1-800-240-5161

The State of Mississippi benefits from forestry, which contributes $12.79
billion to the state's economy, over $20 million (on average) toward education
through School Trust Land timber sale revenue, and employs almost 70,000 people.

Established in 1926, the Mississippi Forestry Commission (MFC) protects the
state's valuable forest resources from wildfire, manages approximately 480,000
acres of forested School Trust Land, and delivers quality forest management
services and assistance to both rural and urban landowners. Our mission is to
provide active leadership in forest protection, forest management, forest
inventory, and effective forest information distribution, necessary for
Mississippi's sustainable forest-based economy.

Tennessee: State Fire Marshal & State Forester Promote Wildfire Preparedness

LENGTH: 717 words



 Nashville: The state of Tennessee has issued the following news release:



 As April wildland fires threaten the lives and property of many Tennesseans,
the State Fire Marshal's Office and the Division of Forestry urge residents to
plan ahead to make their home and property much safer from wildfire.





 Wildfires can have devastating consequences for Tennessee property owners.
Records show over 4,800 wildland/outside fire incidents occurred last year
resulting in over $1.6 million in property damages. Curbing those fires also
took a toll, requiring Tennessee fire service and Division of Forestry personnel
to spend thousands of hours fighting those fires.



 "Wildfires often begin unnoticed," State Fire Marshal and Commerce & Insurance
Commissioner Julie Mix McPeak said. "They spread quickly, igniting brush, trees
and homes. Reduce your risk by preparing now, before a wildfire starts. Meet
with your family to decide what to do and where to go if wildfires threaten your
area."



 Preparedness does not have to be costly or time consuming. With basic planning,
residents can reduce the risk that their homes and property will become fuel for
a wildfire.



 "No one has more control over the safety of a home in advance of a wildfire
than homeowners," said Jere Jeter, State Forester of Tennessee. "Simple Firewise
practices can ensure your home and your family are prepared in the event of a
wildfire."



 Follow the steps below to help protect your loved ones, home, and property from
the dangers of wildfire:



 Plan & Practice Wildfire Safety



     Conduct outdoor burning safely and legally, being sure to secure the
appropriate permits.

     Make sure that fire response vehicles can reach your home. Clearly mark all
driveway entrances and display your name and address. Ensure adequate
accessibility by large fire vehicles to your property.

     Report hazardous conditions that could cause a wildfire.

     Teach children about fire safety. Instill in them that fire is a tool for
adults, not a toy. Keep matches and lighters out of their reach.

     Post fire emergency telephone numbers.

     Plan several escape routes away from your home - by car and by foot.

     Assemble an emergency supply kit and place it in a safe spot. Remember to
include important documents, medications and personal identification.

     Talk to your neighbors about wildfire safety. Consider how you could help
neighbors - such as elderly or disabled persons - who have special needs. Make
plans to take care of children who might be on their own if parents can't get
home.



 Protect Your Home



     Create a 30-to-100-foot safety zone around your home.

     Rake and remove leaves, dead limbs, twigs and rubbish from around and under
structures in this zone and clear all flammable vegetation.

     Prune tree branches and shrubs within 15 feet of a stovepipe or chimney
outlet.

     Ask the power company to clear branches from power lines.


     Regularly clean roofs and gutters, and inspect chimneys.


     Remove vines from the walls of the home.

     Mow and water grass regularly.

     Store gasoline, oily rags and other flammable materials in approved safety
cans. Place cans in a safe location away from the base of buildings.

     Stack firewood at least 100 feet away and uphill from your home. Clear
combustible material within 20 feet. Use only wood-burning devices evaluated by
a nationally recognized laboratory.

     Identify and maintain an adequate outside water source such as a small
pond, cistern, well, swimming pool or hydrant.



 Escape Safely



     If advised to evacuate, do so immediately. Remember to take your emergency
supply kit.

     Lock your home when you go and make sure all windows and doors are closed.

     Wear protective clothing: sturdy shoes, cotton or woolen clothing, long
pants, a long-sleeved shirt, gloves and a handkerchief to protect your face.

     Tell someone when you leave and where you are going.

     Choose a route away from fire hazards. Watch for changes in the speed and
direction of fire and smoke.

Wildfire gets complete reno

BYLINE: John Schreiner

SECTION: SECTION 3, INVESTOR'S GUIDE; Pg. 26, WESTERN MARKETS

LENGTH: 539 words



  SINCE ITS 1981 incorporation, Wildfire Resources Ltd. has neither developed
resources nor grown like wildfire. Shareholder Allen Achilles finally got fed up
last year after the shares slid from a $1.77 high to 22(, and took the company
over himself.

Then last Friday, the shares jumped 26( to close at 60( on the news that
Vancouver promoter Murray Pezim, in an arrangement which will give him 30% of
the company but still leave control with Achilles, has agreed to become chairman
of Wildfire. ''They're going to underwrite me,'' Achilles says of the Pezim
group.

For the other Wildfire shareholders, it means yet another change in corporate
direction. Under its founding management, Wildfire announced and subsequently
abandoned such ventures as: investment in an Oregon home video rental firm;
investment in a Nevada irrigation company; investment in an American air cargo
company; and acquisition of a license to distribute cosmetics. And, of course,
there was a mineral property on which the company's initial public financing
(20( a share in 1983) had been based.

Achilles, a Toronto native and a physical education graduate of the University
of Toronto, has been a Vancouver restaurateur for nine years. Under his
direction, Wildfire - whose name will be changed - is to become a restaurant and
entertainment management company.

Once the regulatory approvals for the deals have been received, Wildfire's
assets will include four Vancouver restaurants with combined 1985 sales of $5
million and a 1986 potential - because of business generated during the world's
fair - which Achilles estimates at $9 million.

Achilles already runs one Vancouver Stock Exchange listing, Spirit Petroleum
Corp. (whose trading range last year was an unexciting 70(-15(), and he plans to
go public with another company, Marian Minerals Corp., which has property in the
Batchawana area in Northern Ontario.

Taking over Wildfire, which had become what Achilles called ''an assetless
shell,'' was a shortcut to getting a listed company through which to raise
equity for expanding his restaurant business.

''The banks don't want to talk to you,'' he says. ''They already own half the
restaurants in the city.''

Achilles owns two Vancouver restaurants, The Town Pump in Gastown and Charlie
Brown's in the city's commercial core. The other two being acquired for Wildfire
(almost entirely with Wildfire shares) are a pair of ailing Mexican-style
Vancouver restaurants called Cisco's.

Achilles thinks the main problem with those restaurants is the limited appeal of
one-theme menus. He plans a more flexible menu, with added live entertainment,
which works in his other restaurants. And he wants to develop a chain. For the
most part, the new units will come by taking over existing but ailing
restaurants which can be had, he says, for ''pennies on the dollar.''

''Why would you build a new one?'' he asks.

The ambitious Achilles has other plans as well for Wildfire, including the
fast-food business and the concert-booking business. Wildfire, he believes, ''is
an interesting way of allowing me to springboard myself in developing a
well-rounded, aggressive, hospitality management business.''

Taxes may go toward fighting wildfires

May 02--BOULDER -- Should Boulder County ask voters to support creating a
sales-tax-supported Forest Improvement District to fund efforts to reduce the
risk of wildfires?

That's one of the ideas county commissioners are scheduled to discuss on Tuesday
afternoon, when they meet with members of an advisory team that's helping craft
a Boulder County Community Wildfire Protection Plan.

"There are many projects and initiatives required to reduce the risk of wildfire
and maintain optimal fire fighting efforts in the county," according to a
written discussion of the Fire Improvement District proposal -- part of a packet
of materials prepared for the commissioners' Tuesday study session.

However, "lack of funding is a major obstacle to undertaking these efforts,"
according to the advisory team's background paper.

The written discussion of the proposal says that when it comes to mitigating
wildfires, "another local funding source is needed to complement resources from
individuals, the private sector, and federal and state government sources."

A 2007 state law allows counties to form special districts that would protect
communities from wildfires and improve the conditions of forests within the
districts.

The Boulder County Community Wildfire Protection Plan's advisory team says that
law offers the county a way to pay for reducing the risk of wildfires, preparing
for emergencies, and reimbursing homeowners who take wildfire-mitigation steps
on their own land -- as well as paying for staffing, communications and
equipment.

But Boulder County commissioners would have to get voters' advance OK before
imposing and collecting any new tax that's proposed to fund the Fire Improvement
District's projects and operating costs.

The advisory team came up with more than a dozen recommendations to be discussed
at the commissioners' Tuesday study session. But the proposal to ask voters'
permission for a tax-supported Fire Improvement District was listed as one of
the team's two "top priorities."

The team's written discussion of the recommendation doesn't suggest how much of
a sales-tax increase might be needed to fund such a district. And it doesn't
identify specific projects, instead saying that those could be identified in a
resolution the commissioners would need to adopt in order to advance the issue
to an election ballot.

The wildfire-protection advisory team's second top-priority recommendation was
for Boulder County to either hire a new staffer -- or reassign a current
employee -- who'd be put in charge of developing and coordinating education and
outreach programs.

"The occurrence of devastating wildland fires has increased substantially in the
last 50 years and is projected to increase further," the advisory team said in
its written discussion of that recommendation.

But "the public is only vaguely aware of this and what we need to do to be
prepared."

The advisory team said that having a specifically designated county staffer
coordinate the county's fire education efforts "can help create a fire-savvy,
responsible and prepared public."

WILDFIRE-RISK STUDY RANKS SPOKANE HIGH Majority of state's most-threatened homes
in this area

BYLINE: Scott Maben scottm@spokesman.com, (208) 758-0260

SECTION: A; Pg. 005

LENGTH: 663 words


Over 18,000 single-family homes in the Spokane-Spokane Valley area are at high
risk of wildfire damage, with more than half of those rated at extreme risk,
according to a new report from real estate data firm CoreLogic.

It would cost an estimated $4.2 billion to replace those homes, the company
said.

More than half of all the homes in Washington that are at extreme or high risk
of wildfire damage are in the Spokane area.

Another 4,500 homes in the metro area are at moderate wildfire damage risk,
representing over $1 billion in reconstruction value, CoreLogic said.

The CoreLogic Wildfire Risk analysis used computer models and geographic
information to examine slope, aspect and fuels to assess wildfire risk in the 13
Western states.

The analysis concluded that 98 percent of vulnerable Washington homes are at low
risk of wildfire damage.

But of the 18,323 homes at extreme risk, just over half are in the Spokane area.
Another 14,272 homes in the state are at high risk, with 61 percent of them in
the Spokane area.

Spokane's wildfire risk stems from its close proximity to forested areas with
volatile fuels and the relatively large population extending from the urban area
into the borderland between the urban and wildland areas, said CoreLogic's
senior hazard scientist, Tom Jeffery.

"Residential growth outward from cities located in areas with wildfire-based
fuels - conifer forest - often puts many of those homes at risk, as well as the
homes located in subdivisions on the outskirts of urban development," Jeffery
said.

So compared to other parts of Washington, the Spokane area has a large number of
homes in close proximity to, or completely within, high-risk areas, he said.

The Washington Department of Natural Resources pays a lot of attention to
wildfire dangers around Spokane, said Joe Smillie, spokesman for the agency.

"Some of that stemmed from Firestorm '91, but there is a long history of
wildfires in the Spokane area because it is relatively dry and elevated,"
Smillie said.

"Wildfires around Spokane can also be very volatile because of the heavy winds
that come out of the Columbia Basin," he said. "If you look at a lot of the burn
patterns from fires around Spokane, they look like cigars. That's because fast
winds tend to grow fires in rapid, narrow paths. Canyons and hills also tend to
contain fires to narrow valleys. Those same fast winds make fires less
predictable, increasing the threat to homes."

Idaho has more than twice as many homes than Washington at extreme or high risk
of damage, placing it fifth nationally behind California, Texas, Colorado and
Oregon on the high end of the scale. Idaho has 67,877 homes in those high-risk
categories, with a potential replacement cost of $15.4 billion.

Idaho has 41,230 homes at extreme risk and 26,647 at high risk, the CoreLogic
analysis shows.

In 2015, wildfires scorched 10 million acres in the U.S. for the first time,
according to the National Interagency Fire Center.

The average burned acreage per year over the previous 20 years was 5.8 million
acres.

DNR puts a lot of focus on trying to reduce the threat that wildfires pose to
homes in Spokane's wildland-urban interface, Smillie said. That includes
reducing the amount of fire fuels, such as brush and tree thickets, on thousands
of acres.

"We will be asking the Legislature in the upcoming session for $3.5 million to
reduce the wildfire threat on 7,980 acres around Spokane," he said. "We'll also
be asking for funding to do some prescribed burns in the area."

The state has helped a dozen communities become fire-wise  by taking steps such
as reducing fire fuels around homes and widening streets, and it's working with
four more neighborhoods now.

"In addition, we have provided grants to nearly all of the rural fire districts
around Spokane so they can have quality wildfire fighting equipment, and will be
asking the legislature for another $5.5 million to add to that program in the
coming biennium," Smillie said.

Preventing farm equipment fires

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. B9

LENGTH: 485  words


Over the past five years, the agriculture industry has been the cause of nearly
260 wildfires, which have burned almost 3,000 hectares of Alberta farmland in
the Forest Protection Area alone. With harvest season here, it's vital to do
what you can to prevent wildfires on your land.

"It's important to check your farm equipment often as buildup such as crop
residue has led to a number of preventable wildfires in Alberta," says Patrick
Loewen, director, wildfire prevention section, Agriculture and Forestry. "Take
the time to check equipment for fire hazards including debris and buildup on the
engine, exhaust system, belts and chains."

Perform regular maintenance on farm equipment to greatly reduce the risk of
wildfire. Make sure you are operating equipment in a safe and responsible
manner. A spark from friction on a rock can smoulder and start a wildfire in
fields and ditches along roadways. Always keep an eye on your surroundings to
prevent a wildfire from spreading.

"Fires from agricultural equipment are not uncommon. If a fire occurs, having a
fire extinguisher on hand to put it out is well worth it. The cost of a fire
extinguisher is small compared to the replacement of equipment or the cost of
fighting a wildfire."

Here are some steps you can take to lower the risk of wildfire on your property.
Check for fire hazards before starting work each day, like: Any buildup of crop
residue around the engine, exhaust system, belts and chains.

Damaged exhaust components.

Worn or frayed belts. Signs of leaking fluids, oils and fuels.

Combines and balers can present different types of problems unique to your
operation. Operators should check for: Buildup of combustible crop residue
around the engine and exhaust system.

Concealed drive belts and pulleys that can contribute to the accumulation of
crop residue that can overheat due to friction.

Regular maintenance is the key to preventing many of the wildfires which occur
from agricultural equipment. Remember to: Keep bearings and gears well
lubricated to prevent buildup.

Remove crop residue from areas prone to generate normal heat.

Replace worn and broken belts as soon as they are discovered.

Keep lubricants at proper levels.

Repair or replace damaged or worn out exhaust systems. In addition to a good
exhaust system, a spark arrester can be installed to catch burning particles.

Repair damaged electrical wiring.

Vehicle safety is also something to keep in mind come harvest season: Manifolds
and exhausts can easily reach temperatures in excess of 250 degrees Celsius,
which can ignite dry grass within minutes.

Vehicles with low ground clearance are especially prone to causing wildfires,
especially in areas with tall vegetation.

Following these steps will help to ensure that your family and your farm remain
safe from the threat of wildfire. For more information on steps you can take to

Idaho: Crapo, Bennet Reintroduce Bill to Increase Resources for Wildfire
Mitigation

LENGTH: 908  words


The Senate Office of United States Senate, Idaho has issued the following news
release:

U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO) and Mike Crapo (R-ID) reintroduced a bill to
provide targeted investments for wildfire mitigation. The bill would help save
future costs related to wildfire response efforts and the damage to property and
land without adding to the deficit.

"FEMA directs a substantial portion of its resources every year to helping
communities at risk of natural disasters prepare for such events by providing
aid for things like flood preparation for hurricanes or modification to houses
in Tornado Alley," said Crapo. "However, it provides very few resources to
communities at risk of being impacted by wildfires, which, those in the west
know all too well, can be devastating to homeowners and communities. This bill
seeks to address that disparity."

"Colorado has experienced catastrophic wildfires that have caused immeasurable
damage," Bennet said. "We need to do more to prepare for these disasters to help
save lives and protect property. This bill targets investments at mitigation
efforts to help reduce the size and scope of fires and in some cases prevent
them from occurring altogether."

The Prepare, Ready, Equip, and Prevent Areas at-Risk of Emergency (PREPARE)
Wildfires Act directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to
establish a funding stream specifically for wildfire mitigation. The bill would
authorize $20 to $30 million per year for a five year wildfire mitigation pilot
program, as part of agency's Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund. States and local
governments would provide matching funds, leveraging federal dollars for maximum
efficiency. The bill would also allow the President to provide post-wildfire
mitigation assistance to States that have received Fire Management Assistance
Grants. This change, which was originally championed by Senator Mark Udall, was
included as a one-year provision in the Fiscal Year 2015 Homeland Security
appropriations bill and will expire on September 30th. The bill also requires
the President to consider post-fire flooding when making "major disaster"
declarations and requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to
create a post-fire funding guide for communities.

The Forest Service reported yesterday that it will spend more than half of its
budget just to help fight wildfires around the country. Additionally, in a new
report the Forest Service released, the agency estimates that within a decade it
will spend more than two-thirds of its budget to battle the increasing threat of
wildfires. This makes it even more important that we invest in cost-saving
mitigation efforts.

Studies have shown that targeted investments in mitigation will prevent and
reduce large-scale wildfires and save money in the long run. A 2007
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) study of FEMA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM)
program found that a very small share of the agency's mitigation funding went to
wildfires. Yet, in the same report, CBO concluded that these infrequently funded
fire mitigation projects have one of the highest returns on investment out of
all the different FEMA mitigation categories, saving more than $5 in future
disaster losses through every $1 in mitigation funding.

Bennet and Crapo teamed up in 2013 to secure a provision in the Senate Homeland
Security appropriations bill directing FEMA to detail its efforts to mitigate
wildfires and identify any funding obstacles for current mitigation programs.

Throughout his career in Congress, Crapo has worked to reduce the risk and
severity of large-scale wildfires. In the U.S. Senate in particular, Crapo
helped enact legislation, including the Healthy Forest Restoration Act and the
Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Act, that have provided land managers
with more tools to counter unhealthy conditions in our nation's forests and
other lands to reduce the fire threat. Crapo recently joined a bipartisan group
of senators in urging President Obama not to reduce timber sales on Forest
Service lands, as he called for in his 2014 budget. The letter stressed the
serious consequences reductions could have on communities across the nation and
the need for increased timber harvests to help mitigate raging wildfires and
help create jobs in our forests.

Additionally, Bennet has worked tirelessly to attract critical federal resources
to help combat wildfires and mitigate their effects. Bennet has called for the
modernization of our air tanker fleet to fight wildfires, led efforts to secure
Emergency Watershed Protection resources to help Colorado communities recover
from the Waldo Canyon and High Park fires, authored key forest health and
wildfire prevention provisions in the Senate Farm Bill and urged the President
to expedite a request from Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper to issue federal
major disaster declarations in response to the Black Forest and Royal Gorge
fires. He led efforts to bring federal assistance to Colorado following the High
Park and Waldo Canyon fires, including organizing a letter of support urging the
President to support Governor Hickenlooper's disaster declaration request.
Bennet is also a cosponsor of the bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act of
2015, which would end "fire borrowing" and the cycle of underfunding fire
suppression.

seeks to address that disparity."

"Colorado has experienced catastrophic wildfires that have caused immeasurable
damage," Bennet said. "We need to do more to prepare for these disasters to help
save lives and protect property. This bill targets investments at mitigation
efforts to help reduce the size and scope of fires and in some cases prevent
them from occurring altogether."

The Prepare, Ready, Equip, and Prevent Areas at-Risk of Emergency (PREPARE)
Wildfires Act directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to
establish a funding stream specifically for wildfire mitigation. The bill would
authorize $20 to $30 million per year for a five year wildfire mitigation pilot
program, as part of agency's Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund. States and local
governments would provide matching funds, leveraging federal dollars for maximum
efficiency. The bill would also allow the President to provide post-wildfire
mitigation assistance to States that have received Fire Management Assistance
Grants. This change, which was originally championed by Senator Mark Udall, was
included as a one-year provision in the Fiscal Year 2015 Homeland Security
appropriations bill and will expire on September 30th. The bill also requires
the President to consider post-fire flooding when making "major disaster"
declarations and requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to
create a post-fire funding guide for communities.

The Forest Service reported yesterday that it will spend more than half of its
budget just to help fight wildfires around the country. Additionally, in a new
report the Forest Service released, the agency estimates that within a decade it
will spend more than two-thirds of its budget to battle the increasing threat of
wildfires. This makes it even more important that we invest in cost-saving
mitigation efforts.

Studies have shown that targeted investments in mitigation will prevent and
reduce large-scale wildfires and save money in the long run. A 2007
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) study of FEMA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM)
program found that a very small share of the agency's mitigation funding went to
wildfires. Yet, in the same report, CBO concluded that these infrequently funded
fire mitigation projects have one of the highest returns on investment out of
all the different FEMA mitigation categories, saving more than $5 in future
disaster losses through every $1 in mitigation funding.

Bennet and Crapo teamed up in 2013 to secure a provision in the Senate Homeland
Security appropriations bill directing FEMA to detail its efforts to mitigate
wildfires and identify any funding obstacles for current mitigation programs.

Throughout his career in Congress, Crapo has worked to reduce the risk and
severity of large-scale wildfires. In the U.S. Senate in particular, Crapo
helped enact legislation, including the Healthy Forest Restoration Act and the
Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Act, that have provided land managers
with more tools to counter unhealthy conditions in our nation's forests and
other lands to reduce the fire threat. Crapo recently joined a bipartisan group
of senators in urging President Obama not to reduce timber sales on Forest
Service lands, as he called for in his 2014 budget. The letter stressed the
serious consequences reductions could have on communities across the nation and
the need for increased timber harvests to help mitigate raging wildfires and
help create jobs in our forests.

Additionally, Bennet has worked tirelessly to attract critical federal resources
to help combat wildfires and mitigate their effects. Bennet has called for the
modernization of our air tanker fleet to fight wildfires, led efforts to secure
Emergency Watershed Protection resources to help Colorado communities recover
from the Waldo Canyon and High Park fires, authored key forest health and
wildfire prevention provisions in the Senate Farm Bill and urged the President
to expedite a request from Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper to issue federal
major disaster declarations in response to the Black Forest and Royal Gorge
fires. He led efforts to bring federal assistance to Colorado following the High
Park and Waldo Canyon fires, including organizing a letter of support urging the
President to support Governor Hickenlooper's disaster declaration request.
Bennet is also a cosponsor of the bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act of
2015, which would end "fire borrowing" and the cycle of underfunding fire
suppression.

Idaho: Crapo, Bennet Reintroduce Bill to Increase Resources for Wildfire
Mitigation

LENGTH: 908  words

The Senate Office of United States Senate, Idaho has issued the following news
release:

U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO) and Mike Crapo (R-ID) reintroduced a bill to
provide targeted investments for wildfire mitigation. The bill would help save
future costs related to wildfire response efforts and the damage to property and
land without adding to the deficit.

"FEMA directs a substantial portion of its resources every year to helping
communities at risk of natural disasters prepare for such events by providing
aid for things like flood preparation for hurricanes or modification to houses
in Tornado Alley," said Crapo. "However, it provides very few resources to
communities at risk of being impacted by wildfires, which, those in the west

Winterfest disappointing for Wildfire

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 346  words


Just when the Waterloo Wildfire seemed ready to move up the ladder in the
National Ringette League's Eastern Conference, they hit a brick wall called the
Montreal Division.

The four teams from that division traveled to Waterloo this weekend to meet the
four teams in the Southern Ontario Division for the Waterloo Winterfest
tournament.

The Wildfire seemed to be on their way, jumping into an early 4- 1 lead against
the Bourassa-Laval- Lanaudiere Nordiques on Saturday afternoon. But the Quebec
team came back to tie the game, banging in three unanswered goals late in the
first half, and netted the winner with less than seven minutes remaining for a
final score of 5-4.

Brianna Thompson led the Wildfire with two goals and an assist, coming back
almost miraculously from an upper body injury suffered a week earlier.

Saturday evening the Wildfire fell behind early 3-0 to the Rive Sud Revolution.
They rallied and were trailing 4-3 at the half, and fired 41 shots overall at
the Revolution net, but still ended up on the short end of a 9-5 final score.
Cocaptain Lindsey Vivian had two goals for the Wildfire in this one.

Sunday morning the Wildfire faced the Conference's secondplace team, the
Montreal Mission, and were tied at 1-1 halfway through the first when they
suddenly took three penalties within a space of 71 seconds. Montreal seized the
opportunity, scoring three power-play goals within 72 seconds to lead 4-1 at the
half.

Two more goals by the Mission late in the second half handed the Wildfire their
third consecutive loss 6-1. Waterloo goalie Amanda Voisin was named the Wildfire
Boston Pizza player of the game after facing 47 Montreal shots.

Sunday afternoon the Wildfire enjoyed some consolation in defeating Lac St.
Louis 3-1, keyed by goalie Lisa Malanka who stopped 23 of the 24 shots.
Cocaptain Bryanna Kelly paced Waterloo with a goal and an assist to earn the
team MVP in that final game.

The 1-3 weekend leaves the Wildfire in seventh place in the Conference. The
Wildfire play the rival Richmond Hill Lightning squad this Saturday at 6:30 p.m.
at RIM Park.

BYLINE: NC Nunn Scott; StarNews Editorial Board; We were surprised when we
clicked on an alert on StarNewsOnline.com recently, expecting, perhaps, a
tornado warning. Instead, we were alerted to a high risk of wildfires.

SECTION: 1,A; GateHouse Media GM9; Pg. 16

We shouldn t have been surprised   weather conditions make this time of year
ripe for wildfires. Brunswick County had a significant wildfire last April. Then
toward the end of last year, North Carolina experienced its worst wildfire
outbreak in history as more than 70,000 acres   110 square miles   burned in the
mountains.

Although wildfires can occur at any time, the three big factors are temperature,
wind and moisture. Our recent sunny, spring-like weather has dried out potential
fuel sources. Add to that a stiff breeze, and even the smallest fire can quickly
get out of control.

Unlike the tornadoes we see this time of year, wildfires are very preventable.
The only significant natural cause is lightning, which caused 77 wildfires in
North Carolina in 2015. That s very low on the list.

Smokey Bear s message must have gotten across, because only 32 North Carolina
wildfires were caused by camping in 2015. Among other causes were smoking (82),
machine use (416) and children (223).

By far the biggest wildfire cause each year   and definitely one we can control
is debris burning (1,671). That is what caused last year s fire near Bolivia, in
which a man was charged with a misdemeanor.

Investigators said Phillip Jenkins fully cooperated and admitted to
unintentionally allowing his debris fire to spread. He obviously didn t mean to
start a wildfire. That is why extra care should be taken at all times, and
especially during high-risk periods. Even if there is no fire ban, note the
weather conditions and err on the side of caution.

Wildfires are insidious in that once they begin, they take on a life of their
own. Sometimes there is little firefighters can do to stop them from spreading.
Not only do they damage property and cost money, they also put lives at danger
especially the lives of firefighters.

Burning is illegal in Wilmington, where yard debris is picked up at no cost on
residents  regular trash day. Debris burning is legal in unincorporated areas of
Brunswick, New Hanover and Pender counties. But please remember: it may be legal
to burn debris, but there are times when it s definitely not a wise decision.

Play it smart and always take extreme caution when burning. The consequences are
too severe not to.

Wildfire consultation for Northern Ireland

BYLINE: Gordon Davidson

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 314 words


WILDFIRES - most of them started deliberately - have become a major problem in
Northern Ireland's countryside, and cannot be reduced without the help of the
public.

In 2017 alone, NI's fire and rescue service attended 2231 gorse fires, which
damaged public and private property, harmed wildlife and put a major drain on
resources.

The province's Department of Agriculture and Department of Justice have now
jointly issued a consultation 'Reducing Wildfires in the Countryside' in an
effort to get the public involved.

NI environment agency chief executive David Small said: "Wildfires put the
safety of firefighters, the public and property at risk. They also have a
devastating impact on local wildlife. Several important nature conservation
sites, including Areas of Special Scientific Interest, were impacted by the 2017
wildfires with significant damage occurring to habitats and species.

"In addition, fighting wildfires is resource intensive and could potentially
impact upon the ability of the fire service to respond to other serious
incidents.

"The NI Wildfire Stakeholders Group considers that the best way forward to
tackle the issue of wildfires in NI is to have an agreed and co-ordinated
strategic approach which we can all jointly work towards," said Mr Small. "This
will help to identify and prioritise key initiatives to help reduce the number
of wildfires in the countryside and to reduce the impacts on the environment and
communities when such incidents occur.

"This public engagement is a vital exercise as it will raise awareness and help
inform the development of this strategic approach, and I would encourage people
to respond so that we can reduce this threat together."

Anthony Harbinson at the Department of Justice added: "Anyone involved in
illegally setting wildfires in the countryside is breaking the law. They risk
not only their own safety, but that of others."

Fall is second most dangerous time of year for wildfires

BYLINE: The Montmorency County Tribune staff

LENGTH: 319  words


Although the recent rains have reduced the risk of wildfire, it won't be long
before we will be seeing some dry fall days. As we move into our fall cleanup,
not only must we monitor loose leaf burning, but it is important that we
remember to be careful when using burn barrels. Each year Michigan residents use
thousands of illegal burn barrels without even knowing it. A legal burn barrel
in Michigan must have a lid, and have holes no larger than three-quarters of an
inch in diameter.

When burning takes place, floating embers called firebrands rise up out of the
fire and can land on nearby vegetation or other flammable objects. Having a lid
on the burn barrel helps reduce the chance of firebrands floating out of the
barrel and starting a wildfire. The small holes provide oxygen to the fire so it
will burn.

Elaine Bush, Michigan State University (MSU) Extension wildfire specialist, says
that 8,000 to 10,000 wildfires occur in Michigan each year. The vast majority of
these fires begin with someone burning debris.

Bush points out those residents who burn debris are responsible for maintaining
the fire. If the fire grows out of control the resident can be fined and
possibly billed for all costs incurred.

"Most people guess that lightning and smoking are the major causes of wildfires
in Michigan," says Bush "In fact on the average, less than five percent of
wildfires begin that way. If people would be more careful burning, whether in a
burn barrel or in fuming leaves and brush, we could prevent thousands of
wildfires each year."

containment of the Ballybunion fire could happen as early as Thursday night,
according to Pam Temmermand, a Cal Fire spokeswoman.

Once full containment is reached, meaning lines have been established around the
perimeter of the 100 acres, crews will spend time putting out hot spots before
declaring the fire completely out.

The fire has remained at 100 acres burned since Monday. No structures have been
damaged or threatened.

The fire near the Eagle Ridge housing development was reported at 7:10 p.m.
Sunday and quickly spread

Authorities do not yet know how the blaze started.

One injury has been reported. On Sunday night, a firefighter lost his footing
and fell about 40 feet. He was taken to St. Louise Regional Hospital for an
evaluation and released.

Alberta quadruples funding for wildfire protection program

BYLINE: Vincent Mcdermott, Fort Mcmurray Today

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 409  words


With the one-year anniversary of last May's wildfire approaching, Agriculture
and Forestry Minister Oneil Carlier announced Thursday the province will
quadruple funding for a wildfire prevention programacross Alberta.

During a tour of a provincial warehouse and air tanker base near the Fort
McMurray International Airport, Carlier announced the province will provide $15
million annually for Alberta's FireSmart program, an increase from the $3.8
million provided last year.

Carlier also announced the government is making a three-year commitment of $45
million, which includes $10.5 million for fire prevention work in the Fort
McMurray area.

"Certainly the painful memories of last year's tragic fire remains fresh in the
memories of Fort McMurray residents," he said. "I want to assure residents of
this community, and Albertans across the province, that our government is
committed to ensuring the necessary resources are in place to protect Albertans
and their community from the threat of wildfire."

FireSmart is a Canadawide program that helps communities fight the risk of
wildfires while simultaneously preparing for them. The funding will go towards
wildfire educational programs, emergency preparedness planning and vegetation
management -such as tree removal initiatives.

Approximately 70 per cent of wildfires in the last five years have been linked
to human activity. According to Carlier's ministry, wildfire crews fought more
than 1,300 fires across Alberta in 2016, including the Fort McMurray fire.

The legislature has also passed legislation aimed at stopping reckless
behaviours that could start wildfires or complicate efforts to fight them,
including hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines and even jail time.

During his visit, Carlier also mentioned the province started wildfire season
earlier this year on March 1, as opposed to last year's mid-April date. The
extra time will allow forestry workers to do last-minute recruiting, carry out
final repairs and inspections of equipment, and prepare key buildings and
vehicles for the season ahead.

Carlier also confirmed he has seen a draft report of the province's review of
Alberta Forestry's initial response to the wildfire.

He could not mention what was in the draft report or what he believed would
definitely end up in the final copy, adding it will be released sometime this
spring or summer. vmcdermott@postmedia.com !@COPYRIGHT=© 2017 Sun Media

Warning of increased wildfire risk

LENGTH: 347  words


The Scottish Wildfire Forum (SWF) is raising awareness about the increased risk
of wildfire across most parts of Scotland over the next few days - as weather
forecasters predict very dry conditions.

Vice chair of the Scottish Wildfire Forum, Michael Bruce, monitors the European
Commission's European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS).

This provides vital information which can be used to inform the public about the
risk of wildfire.

He said: "At the start of spring there is often a lot of dead vegetation
leftover from last year.

"This fuel can dry out quickly when there is overnight frost, followed by sunny
days with higher temperatures and lower humidity levels.

"We have a high pressure weather system developing across Scotland creating
these conditions at the moment."

It is now the time of year when the risk of wildfire is at its highest and The
Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is already working closely with land managers
and appealing to tourists and communities to help reduce the number fires in a
bid to protect the countryside and its residents.

SFRS Deputy Assistant Chief Officer Andy Coueslant is chair of the Scottish
Wildfire Forum.

The senior officer said: "Raising awareness is key to reducing the risk.

"Many rural and remote communities are hugely impacted by wildfires, which can
cause significant environmental and economic damage.

"Livestock, farmland, wildlife, protected woodland and sites of special
scientific interest can all be devastated by these fires - as can the lives of
people living and working in rural communities.

"Human behaviour can significantly lower the chance of a wildfire starting so
it's crucial people act safely and responsibly in rural environments and follow
the countryside code."

The public can help prevent wildfires by making sure they dispose of litter and
smoking materials carefully while in rural areas.

Warning of increased wildfire risk

LENGTH: 347  words


The Scottish Wildfire Forum (SWF) is raising awareness about the increased risk
of wildfire across most parts of Scotland over the next few days - as weather
forecasters predict very dry conditions.

Vice chair of the Scottish Wildfire Forum, Michael Bruce, monitors the European
Commission's European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS).

This provides vital information which can be used to inform the public about the
risk of wildfire.

He said: "At the start of spring there is often a lot of dead vegetation
leftover from last year.

"This fuel can dry out quickly when there is overnight frost, followed by sunny
days with higher temperatures and lower humidity levels.

"We have a high pressure weather system developing across Scotland creating
these conditions at the moment."

It is now the time of year when the risk of wildfire is at its highest and The
Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is already working closely with land managers
and appealing to tourists and communities to help reduce the number fires in a
bid to protect the countryside and its residents.

SFRS Deputy Assistant Chief Officer Andy Coueslant is chair of the Scottish
Wildfire Forum.

The senior officer said: "Raising awareness is key to reducing the risk.

"Many rural and remote communities are hugely impacted by wildfires, which can
cause significant environmental and economic damage.

"Livestock, farmland, wildlife, protected woodland and sites of special
scientific interest can all be devastated by these fires - as can the lives of
people living and working in rural communities.

"Human behaviour can significantly lower the chance of a wildfire starting so
it's crucial people act safely and responsibly in rural environments and follow
the countryside code."

The public can help prevent wildfires by making sure they dispose of litter and
smoking materials carefully while in rural areas.

Warning of increased wildfire risk

LENGTH: 347  words


The Scottish Wildfire Forum (SWF) is raising awareness about the increased risk
of wildfire across most parts of Scotland over the next few days - as weather
forecasters predict very dry conditions.

Vice chair of the Scottish Wildfire Forum, Michael Bruce, monitors the European
Commission's European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS).

This provides vital information which can be used to inform the public about the
risk of wildfire.

He said: "At the start of spring there is often a lot of dead vegetation
leftover from last year.

"This fuel can dry out quickly when there is overnight frost, followed by sunny
days with higher temperatures and lower humidity levels.

"We have a high pressure weather system developing across Scotland creating
these conditions at the moment."

It is now the time of year when the risk of wildfire is at its highest and The
Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is already working closely with land managers
and appealing to tourists and communities to help reduce the number fires in a
bid to protect the countryside and its residents.

SFRS Deputy Assistant Chief Officer Andy Coueslant is chair of the Scottish
Wildfire Forum.

The senior officer said: "Raising awareness is key to reducing the risk.

"Many rural and remote communities are hugely impacted by wildfires, which can
cause significant environmental and economic damage.

"Livestock, farmland, wildlife, protected woodland and sites of special
scientific interest can all be devastated by these fires - as can the lives of
people living and working in rural communities.

Washington: Heinrich Offers Online Resources To Help New Mexicans Prepare For
Wildfire Season

LENGTH: 297  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Martin Heinrich has issued the following news
release:

With wildfire season underway, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) is helping
New Mexicans prepare and stay safe with the wildfire Preparedness & Prevention
Resource Center that provides information on how to protect our communities from
the devastating effects of wildfires. The online resource center includes active
wildfire information, prevention and safety tips, resources for businesses, and
more.


Senator Heinrich also released a 30-second public service announcement (PSA) to
help spread the word about how to stay safe throughout the fire season.
"We must all do our part to prevent unintended fires. With wildfire season
underway, now is the time to get prepared and learn about wildfire danger," said
Senator Heinrich. "These resources and tips aim to provide New Mexicans with the
information they need to reduce the threat of fires to their homes, communities,
and the surrounding forests."
As a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senator
Heinrich is a leading advocate for wildfire funding reform and improvements to
catastrophic wildfire prevention programs in New Mexico, including hazardous
fuel reduction, stewardship contracting, and watershed restoration. Senator
Heinrich is a cosponsor of the Stewardship End Result Contracting Improvement
Act to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires and make it easier for federal
land managers and businesses to partner on long-term, large-scale forest
treatment. Senator Heinrich aslo supportslegislation that would fix the problem
of "fire borrowing," in which the Forest Service must rob funds from other
programs--including fire prevention--to pay for the cost of fighting fires in
bad fire years.

Washington: In Case You Missed It: Walden leads call to action on forest
management reform

LENGTH: 1320  words



Washington: Office of the MP Greg Walden has issued the following news release:

Continuing his efforts to improve the way our federal forests are managed, Rep.
Greg Walden (R-Hood River) led several calls to action recently on the need to
pass forest management reform. Walden, joined by his colleagues on the
Congressional Western Caucus, stressed the need for Congress to fix broken
federal forest policy that leads to catastrophic fires in Oregon and much of the
West.


"As we saw painfully this summer, smoke chokes our citizens, it chokes children.
In my district, elementary school children had to be sent home because of smoke
in their schools because of forest fires," said Walden in a speech on the House
floor. "In Oregon, we've seen some of the worst fires in our state's history. It
seemed as if every day came with new reports of more fire and more smoke. While
this year's fire season has been particularly intense and devastating, images
like these are nothing new for Oregonians." Walden continued, standing beside a
constituent photo of the Eagle Creek fire burning between Cascade Locks and Hood
River.
Walden also led a hearing before the Energy and Commerce Committee -- where he
serves as chairman -- to examine the air quality impacts of wildfire, held a
press conference with Congressional leaders on the need to pass the Resilient
Federal Forests Act, and gave the Western Caucus Weekly Address where he
discussed the horrific wildfire season that burned over 678,000 acres in Oregon.

Continue reading for more on Walden's recent efforts.On Wednesday, Rep. Greg
Walden led a hearing to call attention to the air quality, environmental, and
health impacts of wildfire smoke. Walden, who chairs the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, said examining the impact of devastating wildfires on air
quality needs to be part of the broader conversation on forest management
reform.On Wednesday, Rep. Greg Walden led a hearing to call attention to the air
quality, environmental, and health impacts of wildfire smoke. Walden, who chairs
the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said examining the impact of
devastating wildfires on air quality needs to be part of the broader
conversation on forest management reform.
Wildfire season may be creeping to a close in northeast Oregon, but the fallout
is just beginning to ramp up in Washington, D.C.
The House Committee on Energy and Commerce, chaired by Rep. Greg Walden
(R-Oregon), will hold a hearing Wednesday examining the impacts of large fires
on air quality, releasing massive amounts of particulate matter and greenhouse
gases into the atmosphere.
"Year after year, catastrophic wildfires rage on federal lands, including parts
of my district, and our skies are choked with smoke throughout the West," Walden
said during a Sept. 13 House committee hearing. "Air quality issues in my home
state continue to rise to dangerous levels because of these fires, forcing
cancellations of community events, school closures and lost tourism dollars."
The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality maintains 35 air particulate
monitors statewide, including one in Pendleton. Between July 1 and Sept. 6, the
local air quality index was listed as "moderate" for 13 days, "unhealthy for
sensitive groups" for five days, "unhealthy" for one day and "very unhealthy"
for one day.
Greg Walden applauds wildfire funding request, call for forest management reform
from administration
Later Wednesday, Rep. Walden applauded additional wildfire funds and a call to
action on forest management reform from the administration. The Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) included $576.5 million in wildfire funding in their
supplemental budget request to Congress, as well as recommendations that active
forest management and forestry reform be part of the solution to curb wildfire
borrowing. Walden led a letter signed by a bipartisan group of 31 lawmakers to
OMB Director Mick Mulvaney to ask that wildfires be treated like natural
disasters, and that the administration work with Congress to pass forest
management reforms.
Walden cheers Trump administration wildfire funding and call to action on forest
management reform
Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore.,  applauded word of additional wildfire funds and a
call to action on forest management reform in a supplemental budget request
Wednesday from the Trump administration.
The Office of Management and Budget included $576.5 million in wildfire funding
in their supplemental budget request to Congress on Wednesday, as well as
recommendations that active forest management and forestry reform be part of the
solution to curb wildfire borrowing.
"I want to thank the Trump administration for their request for funds to cover
the costs of this fire season, as well as their call for Congress to reform our
broken federal forest policy that hinders them from implementing much needed
forest management," Walden said.
"Another fire season winds down and, once again, the Forest Service needed to
rob money from important fire prevention work to pay for fighting wildfires," he
said. "We must not only supplement those accounts to pay for the cost of this
fire season, but it's past time that we fix how we pay for fires and treat them
like the natural disasters they are."
Walden applauds extra firefighting funding request
U.S. Rep. Greg Walden (R-Hood River) is pleased that the Office of Management
and Budget added $576.5 million in wildfire funding in the supplemental budget
request to Congress. He also praised OMB for recommending that active forest
management and forestry reform be a part of the solution to curb wildfire
borrowing.
"I want to thank the Trump administration for their request for funds to cover
the costs of this fire season, as well as their call for Congress to reform our
broken federal forest policy that hinders them from implementing much-needed
forest management," he said. "Another fire season winds down and, once again,
the Forest Service needed to rob money from important fire prevention work to
pay for fighting wildfires."
Walden, along with the Democratic members of the Oregon delegation to Congress
argue that the cost for fighting big wildfires should come from disaster funds,
not the fire prevention budget of the U.S. Forest Service.
On Thursday, Walden held a press conference with his colleagues on the Western
Caucus to discuss the current wildfire threat in the western United States, a
fix to so-called "fire borrowing", and legislation to improve management of the
country's federal forests. Walden discussed the importance of passing the
Resilient Federal Forests Act, introduced by Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Arkansas),
which would help bring proper management back to federal forests.
"We need this bill passed so we can go in and have our professional, scientific
foresters do their work to get back in balance with nature," said Walden of the
Resilient Federal Forests Act. "We need to pass this so we can protect our
watersheds, so we can have healthy air sheds, and so we can replant after these
forest fires."
Finally, Walden delivered the weekly address for the Congressional Western
Caucus. During the address Walden discussed the horrific wildfire season that
burned over 678,000 acres in Oregon, and further addressed the need to reform
federal forest policy to prevent catastrophic fires.
"The bottom line is: Enough is enough. Dense fuel loads from a lack of
management, caused by red tape and gridlock leave a tinderbox in our forests
waiting to ignite," said Walden in his address. "It is long past time for
Congress to reform how federal forests are managed. If we do not act, these
fires will continue to destroy our lands, pour carbon and pollutants into our
atmosphere, threaten habitat and water supplies, and put people and property in
harm's way. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Western Caucus
to get this job done."

Tips to prevent farm equipment fires

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A2

LENGTH: 485  words


Over the past five years, the agriculture industry has been the cause of nearly
260 wildfires, which have burned almost 3,000 hectares of Alberta farmland in
the Forest Protection Area. With harvest season here, it's vital to do what you
can to prevent wildfires on your land.

"It's important to check your farm equipment often as buildup such as crop
residue has led to a number of preventable wildfires in Alberta," says Patrick
Loewen, director, wildfire prevention section, Agriculture and Forestry.

"Take the time to check equipment for fire hazards including debris and buildup
on the engine, exhaust system, belts and chains."

Perform regular maintenance on farm equipment to greatly reduce the risk of
wildfire. Make sure you are operating equipment in a safe and responsible
manner.

A spark from friction on a rock can smoulder and start a wildfire in fields and
ditches along roadways.

Always keep an eye on your surroundings to prevent a wildfire from spreading.

"Fires from agricultural equipment are not uncommon. If a fire occurs, having a
fire extinguisher on hand to put it out is well worth it. The cost of a fire
extinguisher is small compared to the replacement of equipment or the cost of
fighting a wildfire."

Here are some steps you can take to lower the risk of wildfire on your property.
Check for fire hazards before starting work each day, like: any buildup of crop
residue around the engine, exhaust system, belts and chains; damaged exhaust
components; worn or frayed belts; signs of leaking fluids, oils and fuels;
Combines and balers can present different types of problems unique to your
operation.

Operators should check for: buildup of combustible crop residue around the
engine and exhaust system; concealed drive belts and pulleys that can contribute
to the accumulation of crop residue that can overheat due to friction; regular
maintenance is the key to preventing many of the wildfires which occur from
agricultural equipment. Remember to: keep bearings and gears well lubricated to
prevent buildup; remove crop residue from areas prone to generate normal heat;
replace worn and broken belts as soon as they are discovered; keep lubricants at
proper levels; repair or replace damaged or worn out exhaust systems. In
addition to a good exhaust system, a spark arrester can be installed to catch
burning particles; repair damaged electrical wiring; vehicle safety is also
something to keep in mind come harvest season; manifolds and exhausts can easily
reach temperatures in excess of 250 degrees Celsius, which can ignite dry grass
within minutes.

Vehicles with low ground clearance are especially prone to causing wildfires,
especially in areas with tall vegetation.

Following these steps will help to ensure that your family and your farm remain
safe from the threat of wildfire. For more information on steps you can take to

Bennet, Crapo Secure Provision to Prioritize Wildfire Mitigation Efforts

LENGTH: 489  words


Office of The Senator Michael Bennet, U.S Government has issued the following
news release:

U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO) and Mike Crapo (R-ID) have secured a measure
in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations Bill to help
prioritize wildfire mitigation efforts. The bill directs the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) to develop a report detailing its efforts to mitigate
wildfires and identify any funding obstacles for current mitigation programs.

Last week, Bennet and Crapo urged the Subcommittee to push FEMA to use a greater
share of its mitigation funding to prevent catastrophic wildfires. In the letter
to the subcommittee's chair and ranking member, Bennet and Crapo shared concerns
about inadequate funding and recommended the report as a first step.

Specifically, the Bennet-Crapo measure in the bill says, "Over the last decade,
wildfires have caused an average of over $1,000,000,000 in economic damages,
killed over 150 Americans, and destroyed thousands of homes and other structures
across the Nation. The six worst wildfire seasons in the past 50 years in the
United States have all occurred since 2000. The Committee is concerned that
mitigation efforts are not keeping pace with the growing risk. FEMA is directed
to provide a report to the Committee no later than 120 days after the date of
enactment of this act on the efforts being made to mitigate wildfires including
FEMA technical assistance, information sharing, and grant expenditures for the
last 5 years. FEMA should also identify any funding obstacles for wildfires in
its current mitigation programs."

A 2007 CBO study of FEMA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program found that a
very small share of the agency's funding went to wildfires. Yet, in the same
report, CBO concluded that for every dollar FEMA has spent through the PDM fund
on wildfire mitigation, it has saved more than $5 in future disaster losses.

"Colorado and communities throughout the West are facing increasingly
devastating wildfire seasons. They continue to grow in frequency and intensity,"
Bennet said. "This bill sends a message to FEMA that wildfire mitigation
programs are a priority and should be expanded in the future. They've proven to
make a tangible difference and may help us prevent the tragic and unprecedented
loss of life and staggering levels of destruction we have endured over the past
decade."

"Idahoans know firsthand how devastating fire season can be," Crapo said. "Last
year, more than 1,000 wild land fires burned more than 1.6 million acres in
Idaho alone and we are already seeing a number of fires this season. I applaud
the work of the Appropriations Committee and thank them for making wildfire
mitigation a top priority. This bill will provide FEMA the resources to help our
western states mitigate for the devastating wildfire season even before it
starts."

Wildfires is a year-round threat caused by drought

BYLINE: By Ellen Knickmeyer

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 485 words


SAN FRANCISCO >> Big wildfires have burned almost four times as many California
acres as usual so far this winter, a sign of wildfire danger growing higher
still as the state moves into its fourth year of drought.

The high fire risk from the drought means the California Department of Forestry
and Fire Protection is maintaining its highest level ever of seasonal
firefighters straight through the winter, statewide. The department also will go
up to peak summertime staffing as soon as early June, four to six weeks earlier
than normal, fire chief Ken Pimlott said.

"It's changing the dynamic, absolutely," Pimlott said by telephone, referring to
the near-statewide drought. "The conditions are

Wildfire Â» Page 5

absolutely ripe" for a big year for wildfires.

California, with its Mediterranean climate of winter rain and snow and dry
summers, normally experiences winter as the offseason for fighting firefighters.
A normal year lays down a blanket of snow in the Sierra Nevada that melts
through the spring, helping keep grass and shrubs too wet to burn. In a normal
year, winter wildfires will burn no more than a dozen acres or so before
flickering out, department spokesman Daniel Berlant said.

This year, fires keep burning, due to tinder-dry fuel, Berlant said. In a normal
year, large wildfires in areas under his department's jurisdiction will have
burned 800 acres by this time of year. This winter, it's 3,200 acres, and
counting.

Southern California long has had winter wildfires. This year, so has Northern
California, including even foggy, forested Humboldt County, which gets more than
4 feet of rain in a non-drought year.

"In some of the wettest places in the country, we were having 300-, 400-acre
fires," Pimlott said.

And in Central California, a wildfire burning entirely above what would have
been the Sierra Nevada snowline burned 7,000 acres and 40 homes - in early
February.

"It pretty much burned the same at 4,000 feet all the way up to 8,000 feet,"
said Bennet Milloy, a department firefighter paramedic, and spokesman, who was
at the scene of that fire, which broke out Feb. 6 in the eastern Sierras.

At the scene of that winter wildfire, "there was almost no snowpack, just a
light dusting of snow," Milloy recalled. With no grass, given the drought, the
wildfire jumped from bush to bush, which were "pre-cured and dried and ready to
burn," Milloy said.

The drought, and a warming climate here, has had firefighters battling
larger-than-usual wildfires for years now. Half of the state's largest wildfires
on record occurred since 2000, Berlant said.

At peak staffing later this year, the state forestry department will have more
than 300 fire engines stationed around the state. With the drought, the state
also has added a fourth person to each fire-engine's normal three-person crew.
The state will bring additional firefighters and aircraft on line as well,
Pimlott said.

Wisconsin: Smokey Bear turns 70 on August 9

LENGTH: 578  words

DNR, The state of Wisconsin has issued the following news release:

Smokey says he is ready for 70 more years of preventing wildfires as the star of
the nation's longest-running public service advertising campaign. Who knows
Smokey Bear? An Ad Council survey says 97 percent of adults know Smokey Bear and
3 out of 4 adults can recite (without hint or prompt) Smokey's most powerful
message: "Only You Can Prevent Wildfires."

So powerful is that message fire experts say Smokey has helped reduce the number
of acres lost every year to wildfires from roughly 22 million in 1944 (when
Smokey started his campaign) to an average of 6.7 million annually today. Yet,
Smokey's message remains as relevant today as 70 years ago because wildfire
prevention remains a critical issue and people are still the number one cause of
forest fires. Plus, as Smokey's birthday candles are being prepared, wildfire
crews are working hard suppressing forest fires in the western United States.

Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources recently sent a 20-person wildfire
hand-crew of members from various government agencies to Boise, Idaho, to assist
with the wildfire suppression efforts. Another 6-person DNR hand-crew also is on
its way to the state of Oregon. They will become part of another 20-member
wildfire hand-crew to assist with fire-fighting efforts in western states. Also,
several single resources or overhead positions have been mobilized this past
weekend to assist in the western fire situation.

"We are always prepared for the weather to take a turn for the worst, but if we
do not find ourselves in a critical fire situation at home, we most certainly
are willing to send resources to areas of the country in need," DNR Wildfire
Prevention Specialist Catherine Koele says. "This is a two-way street. We send
help to other states when requested. And, if we are facing needs in times of
emergencies, we also will get that extra assistance in return."

Wisconsin's peak fire season typically occurs in the spring shortly after the
snow-cover disappears. This also is the time landowners are outside conducting
property clean-up and choosing to burn ground materials instead of composting or
recycling.

"Many people think that lightening starts most wildfires. In fact, 9 out of 10
wildfires nationwide are started by humans," Koele said. "Wildfires sparked by
humans in Wisconsin are most commonly caused by debris or trash burning on windy
days. The easiest way to prevent these fires is to simply obtain a burn permit
and follow the rules."

Other common wildfire causes include:

campfires left unattended;
    disposing ashes from woodstoves or fireplaces; and
    operating hot equipment in dry grassy areas.

To commemorate Smokey's birthday, the DNR will be hosting several events at
state parks, state forests, Wisconsin State Fair, DNR ranger stations and local
fire departments. In addition, many libraries are conducting summer reading

Wisconsin: Smokey Bear turns 70 on August 9

LENGTH: 578  words


DNR, The state of Wisconsin has issued the following news release:

Smokey says he is ready for 70 more years of preventing wildfires as the star of
the nation's longest-running public service advertising campaign. Who knows
Smokey Bear? An Ad Council survey says 97 percent of adults know Smokey Bear and
3 out of 4 adults can recite (without hint or prompt) Smokey's most powerful
message: "Only You Can Prevent Wildfires."

So powerful is that message fire experts say Smokey has helped reduce the number
of acres lost every year to wildfires from roughly 22 million in 1944 (when
Smokey started his campaign) to an average of 6.7 million annually today. Yet,
Smokey's message remains as relevant today as 70 years ago because wildfire
prevention remains a critical issue and people are still the number one cause of
forest fires. Plus, as Smokey's birthday candles are being prepared, wildfire
crews are working hard suppressing forest fires in the western United States.

Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources recently sent a 20-person wildfire
hand-crew of members from various government agencies to Boise, Idaho, to assist
with the wildfire suppression efforts. Another 6-person DNR hand-crew also is on
its way to the state of Oregon. They will become part of another 20-member
wildfire hand-crew to assist with fire-fighting efforts in western states. Also,
several single resources or overhead positions have been mobilized this past
weekend to assist in the western fire situation.

"We are always prepared for the weather to take a turn for the worst, but if we
do not find ourselves in a critical fire situation at home, we most certainly
are willing to send resources to areas of the country in need," DNR Wildfire
Prevention Specialist Catherine Koele says. "This is a two-way street. We send
help to other states when requested. And, if we are facing needs in times of
emergencies, we also will get that extra assistance in return."

Wisconsin's peak fire season typically occurs in the spring shortly after the
snow-cover disappears. This also is the time landowners are outside conducting
property clean-up and choosing to burn ground materials instead of composting or
recycling.

"Many people think that lightening starts most wildfires. In fact, 9 out of 10
wildfires nationwide are started by humans," Koele said. "Wildfires sparked by
humans in Wisconsin are most commonly caused by debris or trash burning on windy
days. The easiest way to prevent these fires is to simply obtain a burn permit
and follow the rules."

Other common wildfire causes include:

campfires left unattended;
    disposing ashes from woodstoves or fireplaces; and
    operating hot equipment in dry grassy areas.

To commemorate Smokey's birthday, the DNR will be hosting several events at
state parks, state forests, Wisconsin State Fair, DNR ranger stations and local
fire departments. In addition, many libraries are conducting summer reading
programs to help children understand the differences between good fires and bad
fires.

Washington: Feinstein Joins Bipartisan Group of Senators to Urge Trump
Administration to Prioritize Federal Funding for Wildfires

LENGTH: 876 words



Washington: Office of the Senator Dianne Feinstein has issued the following news
release:
Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) joined a bipartisan group of Western
Senators including Senators Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Mike
Crapo (R-Idaho), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Maria Cantwell
(D-Wash.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Tom Udall (D-N.M.) in a letter requesting
the Trump Administration to prioritize emergency funding ahead of the next
disaster assistance legislation that the Senate will consider in the upcoming
weeks. The Senators wrote, "In times of crisis, our nation has always come
together to support our fellow Americans in critical need of assistance, and we
believe that the federal government has a duty to help those affected by natural
disasters with any and all of its capabilities."
In light of the ongoing wildfires throughout California and other Western
states, the Senators specifically request for an increase to the "Disaster Cap"
- a tool used to fund the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and other agencies
providing emergency relief for victims of all disasters.


The letter also highlights this group of Senators' support for The Wildfire
Disaster Funding Act, a bill that would fix the way the federal government
budgets for wildfire by treating them like other natural disasters. Passage of
this bill also will free up much needed money for fire prevention work in the
future.
The Honorable Donald J. Trump
 The White House
 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
 Washington, DC 20500
Dear Mr. President:
In light of the ongoing wildfires throughout the Western states, we strongly
urge your administration to prioritize emergency funding to meet the needs of
the firefighters and the communities affected by these devastating natural
disasters. In times of crisis, our nation has always come together to support
our fellow Americans in critical need of assistance, and we believe that the
federal government has a duty to help those affected by natural disaster with
any and all of its capabilities.
We appreciate your swift action in declaring a Major Disaster recently for the
wildfires in Northern California, which have destroyed over 6,900 homes and
buildings, scorched over 245,000 acres, and forced thousands to evacuate over
the past weeks. Tragically, this catastrophe has already claimed the lives of 42
people. Unfortunately, this event highlights that wildfires have grown more
extreme and will only become more frequent, as demonstrated by the number and
severity of wildfires that have occurred in the past decade. Since the beginning
of this year, nearly 9 million acres have already burned nationwide, and the
wildfires have shown no signs of slowing down. The destruction caused by these
wildfires has claimed and will continue to claim lives, homes, and businesses,
and will cost communities millions of dollars in economic loss.
The fires currently devastating our nation underscore the need to ensure that
additional attention and federal resources can be brought to bear in both
preventing and fighting wildfires. The Disaster Cap Adjustment has been a
critical tool in funding the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and other
agencies providing emergency relief for victims of all disasters. However, the
amounts available in the Disaster Cap have been decreasing over time and is not
sufficient to encompass all disasters. Therefore, we urge you to work with our
colleagues to increase the Disaster Cap to ensure that there are adequate levels
of federal funding to respond to all disasters, including the wildfires that
have and will continue to affect our nation.
In addition, we have supported a bipartisan solution called The Wildfire
Disaster Funding Act, which would fix the way the federal government budgets for
wildfire by treating them like other natural disasters - a fix that Secretary
Perdue has indicated to the Office of Management and Budget would be helpful.
Passage of this bill also will free up much needed money for fire prevention
work in the future. As we work with our colleagues in Congress to pass
supplemental disaster packages that will provide essential relief to millions of
Americans in need, we will continue to push for inclusion of a wildfire budget
fix.
We urge you to make it a priority that all Americans who need emergency
assistance get what they need, whether affected by a hurricane, wildfire, or
other disaster. Since the beginning of this year, wildfires have ravaged nearly
9 million acres across our nation from Alaska to Florida and have taken
significant tolls on our local communities and economies. We hope to continue to
work with your administration on programs administered by the FEMA, USDA, the
Small Business Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
and other federal agencies, in order to help communities and victims recover
from these tragic events.
Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to working with you on how to
best assist all those who have been severely impacted by disasters across the
United States.
Sincerely,

Editorial: PG&E records show utility cannot be trusted

BYLINE: Mercury News Editorial Board

LENGTH: 628 words



HIGHLIGHT: Even if PG&E is not to blame for the Wine Country wildfires ,
Californians must come to grips with the fact that the utility's maintenance
record shows it cannot be trusted.


We still dont know what started the horrific Wine Country wildfires that killed
42 people and destroyed 8,000 structures this month. But whether or not they
were sparked by PG&Es arcing wires, a California Public Utilities Commission
audit shows the utility cannot be trusted.

Its time for California to act.

PG&E helped stall effort to map risky power lines prone to wildfires

Wildfires like the Wine Countrys affect rich and poor differently

Will PG&E face months of wildfire investigations?

CPUC launches investigation into Wine Country wildfires; probes PG&E activities
in fire zones

Did PG&E adequately maintain power lines before fires?

PG&E violated safety rules, was late on thousands of Wine Country electricity
inspections and work orders      The Bay Area News Groups George Avalos reported
Thursday on the state audit by the PUC showing that PG&E violated
electricity-grid safety regulations at least 11 times in the North Bay in the
years prior to this falls ferocious fires. The PUC said that the utility had
also failed in thousands of instances over a five-year period to conduct timely
inspections and work orders required by the state regulator.

Thats since the 2010 San Bruno gas line explosion that killed eight people and
destroyed 38 homes.

During the same five-year period, PG&E pocketed about $1 billion in profits
every year.

The PUC should immediately reduce PG&Es guaranteed profit level.  When the
utility went bankrupt in 2001, the PUC guaranteed shareholders an 11.3 percent
return on equity, about a percentage point above the industry standard. If
cutting their profit doesnt get PG&Es attention, it may be time to begin the
complex process of breaking up PG&E and to seek another, safer system to provide
gas and electrical service to its 16 million customers.

Like our Facebook page for more conversation and news coverage from San Jose,
the Bay Area and beyond.

PG&E is a convicted felon. It was fined $1.6 billion for negligence in the San
Bruno disaster. A U.S. District Court jury in San Francisco found the utility
guilty of deliberately impeding the investigation by the National Transportation
Safety Board.

PG&E also has a long history of diverting maintenance funds into profits for
shareholder dividends and executive bonuses. It has fought attempts by
legislators to make the utility more transparent.

A federal judge ordered PG&E to conduct a $3 million advertising campaign to
apologize for its conduct. In those ads, which began airing in March 2017, the
utility said, On Sept. 9, 2010, PG&E learned a tragic lesson we can never
forget.

But two months after PG&E began running its ads, the consulting firm Northstar
reported in May, seven years after San Bruno, to the PUC its findings from an
exhaustive review of PG&Es overall safety performance. The executive summary
said:

Get tech news in your inbox weekday mornings. Sign up  for the free Good Morning
Silicon Valley newsletter.

The report reveals that since PG&Es 2010 San Bruno gas transmission pipeline
explosion, PG&E has repeatedly stated its intention to change its safety
culture.   Nevertheless, the report also finds that PG&Es overall progress is
uneven across its gas and electric lines of business, and that while there are
many programs underway, they do not yet add up to a consistent, robust, and
accountable corporate-wide safety program.  PG&Es efforts to date fall short of
the findings of the Independent Review Panel, and the expectations of the
Commission, community leaders, and ratepayers.

Its a damning but not surprising summation of PG&Es repeated failures to earn
Californians trust. Its time for the PUC, the governor and the Legislature to
look at alternatives.

helicopters and 33 engines, are battling the blaze, according to Cal Fire.

Authorities do not yet know how the blaze started.

The fire has been particularly challenging to fight because of the hilly terrain
and heavy underbrush, Temmermand said.

One injury has been reported. On Sunday night, a firefighter lost his footing
and fell about 40 feet. He was taken to St. Louise Regional Hospital for an
evaluation and released.

Operation Wildfire established to investigate gorse fires

BYLINE: Meadhbh Monahan

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 638 words


Wildfire experts have assisted the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in
investigating major gorse fires at Mullaghfad Forest outside Fivemiletown and
Moninea Bog near Garvary which destroyed the specially protected habitats two
months ago.

READ: Major gorse fire in Fivemiletown

Operation Wildfire is a new joint operation that brings together experts from
the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA), the PSNI and the Northern
Ireland Fire & Rescue Service (NIFRS), who have been assisted by a team of
international wildfire investigators from the European Forest Institute and
European Forest Risk Facility (FRISK). The international FRISK team included
specialists from the European Forest Institute, South Wales Fire and Rescue
Service, Dutch Police and Dutch Fire and Rescue Service.
The initial work of Operation WildFire will be to determine the origin of a
number of the recent fires and their causes. The team says this is an essential
first step in any successful fire investigation and can help lead to
prosecutions should the fires be shown to be caused by human action.
Forty-five fire fighters battled against a wildfire that began in Mullaghfad
Forest on May 7 and which stretched for eight miles. A 55-year-old man was
arrested bailed pending further enquiries. Operation Wildfire will focus on this
incident - Mullaghfad Forest is part of the Slieve Beagh Area of Special
Scientific Interest (ASSI). The team will also examine fires that took hold in
specially protected areas around Lisnaskea. A fire at Moninea Bog ASSI near
Garvary will also be subject to the investigation.
There were more than 30 fires reported around County Fermanagh in early May
which also included Cuilcagh Mountain, Belleek, Five Points and Derrylin.
Director of Friends of the Earth James Orr said Fermanagh's natural habitats and
cultural landscapes "are being destroyed by these vandals."
Welcoming the new joint operation, Colum McDaid who leads on wildfire control
initiatives in NIEA said: "The vigorous and thorough investigation of wildfires
is the key to catching arsonists, and can be critical in identifying serial
arsonists before they can move on to bigger targets.
"The law states that burning of vegetation such as heather, gorse, whin or fern
must not be carried out between 15 April and 31 August, and only carried out at
other times of the year under controlled and expert supervision. Additional
offences can be caused by fires that impact on designated sites such as Area of
Special Scientific Interest and their features. Landowners are required to
obtain consent from DAERA for prescribed burning within designated sites."
Constable Darryl Johnston, operational planning PSNI added: "Wildfires are
illegal and the deliberate setting of wildfires is a criminal offence. We hope
to use the Operation Wildfire investigations to determine the cause and origin
of a number of the recent fires with the ultimate aim of serving in court cases
and deterring arsonists.
"If members of the public have information about anyone who has started
wildfires, please let the PSNI know so that we can pursue them through the
courts. Not only do these fires cause widespread damage to our precious
countryside, but they can also put lives at risk."
Also welcoming the joint operation, Mark Smyth Station Commander and NIFRS Lead
Officer for Wildfires said: "NIFRS attended 983 gorse fires in May 2017, 801 of
which took place from May 1-12. More than 90 per cent of these gorse fires were
started deliberately, but given the nature of the fires and their rapid spread,
identifying the exact origin and cause of the fire while actively fighting the
fires has been difficult. We look forward to working alongside our partner
agencies and the wildfire investigators as we visit the sites of some of the
larger gorse fires we dealt with."

Oklahoma wildfires by the numbers, quotes, pictures

BYLINE: BY KYLE FREDRICKSON

LENGTH: 497 words


When the calendar rolls to May and the state's climate reaches its peak of
instability, so does the potential for serious damage fueled by Mother
Nature.But according to data compiled by Oklahoma Forestry Services, not
historically from wildfires.That changed in 2014.Oklahoma was hit with a
weeklong May wildfire breakout that hadn't been seen for at least the last nine
years. Drought and weather combined to create pristine conditions for a small
spark to turn into massive blaze.1. Here's a closer look at the numbers -
compiled by forestry services, state and federal agencies - that help make sense
of wildfire trends in Oklahoma from 2005 to 2013:- Oklahoma wildfires have
burned 955,772 acres. That averages to about 106,000 acres per year.- The state
saw the highest wildfire activity in March, when 364 wildfires burned 30,184
acres in an average year.- 174,683 acres burned in April 2009, the most in any
month of any year.

The most wildfires seen in one month: March 2005, when 651 blazes were sparked
in the state.- Over the past nine years, there was just 1 month with no recorded
wildfire activity: July 2007.- With more than 30,000 acres burned this May,
we've already eclipsed the state's total amount from all of 2013: 18,394
acres.(Disclaimer: Mark Goeller, assistant director of Oklahoma Forestry
Services, said the process of documenting burned acreage from wildfires is an
imperfect system. The state created an online reporting site for fire department
officials to enter that data, but its use is not required.)2. A quick look at
the quotes that helped define the May wildfire outbreak:"He called me and I
tried to tell him to go, all the neighbors did, too, but he's stubborn. Now,
I've come to see if there's anything left of it."- Amber Knox, of Guthrie, when
asked why her father did not evacuate his mobile home before it was destroyed by
the Logan County Fire on May 4. Knox sorted through the charred remains of the
home the morning after her father, Johnnie Knox, 56, was killed in the
blaze."This is the biggest fire I've ever been on, and it moved the fastest I've
ever seen. We've had some big fires, but this one was massive."- David Ball,
emergency management director for Logan County and the city of Guthrie, on the
Logan County fire that burned 3,250 acres in about three days."We have not had
to battle two large ones in our county at the same time of this nature as far
back as I can recall. A lot of acreage, but a little less than what we
thought."- Matt Lehenbauer, Woodward County emergency management director, on
two county wildfires that burned simultaneously over about 27,800 combined
acres."If things don't change, we're in for a long summer. We shouldn't have
this fire behavior the first week of May."- Eric Harlow, Guthrie Fire Chief, on
drought conditions aiding early-season wildfire growth.3. The NewsOK photo staff
was hard at work capturing the Logan County wildfire and its aftermath. A few of
their most striking images:

State urges wildfire wariness;
Season as bad or worse than 2007 expected

Southeast Georgia is turning green again, ending winter's prescribed burns to
clear out the fallen leaves and dry brush that could otherwise fuel this year's
wildfires.

But with officials predicting a fire season as bad as or worse than 2007's
half-million charred acres, South Georgia officials are urging residents to stay
informed and be ready to evacuate.

"We hope we've learned from everything that happened last spring," said Frank
Sorrells, state Forestry Commission district ranger for the 15-county region.

The prescribed burns began about Christmas on tree plantations to reduce
tinder-dry fuel including duff, pine straw, downed tree limbs and underbrush,
Sorrells said.

In January, state rangers assisted with the prescribed burning of 3,139 acres
around the Okefenokee Swamp, he said.

"Prescribed burns for hazard reduction are winding down because the green-up is
starting now," Sorrells said.

Some tree farmers, however, continue raking up pine straw and downed limbs to
create fuel-free buffers between their trees.

Wildfire prevention is a year-round priority for companies like Plum Creek
Timber Co. Inc., which has about 850,000 acres of trees in Georgia and about
600,000 acres in Florida.

Plum Creek lost about 5,000 acres of trees in Florida and about 1,000 acres in
Georgia to wildfires last year, said Phil Parker, company senior resource
manager in Florida.

The company relies on intensive forest management practices including the use of
herbicides to reduce fuel that can accumulate around the trees, Parker said.

"We do little controlled burning because of the liability involved with smoke on
the highways," Parker said.

Plum Creek continuously maintains the network of roads on its timber plantations
to ensure access for company and state forestry firefighters should a blaze
ignite, he said.

"We have good cooperation between the company and the Florida and Georgia
divisions of forestry," Parker said.

STILL SUSCEPTIBLE DESPITE RAINS

Georgia's wildfire season historically runs from February through May but varies
with the weather conditions, Forestry Commission records showed.

Southeast Georgia has gotten more rain than other parts of the state, but the
prolonged drought still leaves the area susceptible to wildfires, Sorrells said.

"It's probably going to get pretty dry beginning now," he said

Below-normal rainfall is anticipated in March and April. Because of the drought,
any rain that does fall will dry up fast, raising the fire danger, he said.

Since October, 297 wildfires have burned 2,003 acres in the region, commission
records show.

The largest blaze, on Feb. 6, destroyed 317 acres of trees near Manioc in
southern Charlton County, Sorrells said.

State rangers noticed a disturbing pattern in those fires, Sorrells said.

"The fires are burning hotter and spreading faster," he said.

The 15-county district boasts about 5 million acres of natural and commercial
forests. Last spring's wildfires burned 441,706 acres, or 8.8 percent, of those
trees, rangers have said.

A downed power line in Ware County sparked the largest of those wildfires but
burning yard debris, lightning and arsonists ignited others.

NOT ALL WILDFIRES ARE NATURAL

Rangers can't do anything about the weather, but they're working to change the
human behavior that contributes to wildfires.

"The No. 1 cause of wildfires is people doing debris burning in their yards,"
Sorrells said.

People should watch the weather, especially the wind, get burn permits and never
leave a fire unattended, he said.

"If they have to leave, put the fire out by soaking it thoroughly," Sorrells
said.

Burn permits will be issued on a day-to-day basis depending on the weather and
no one should burn without first calling a local Georgia Forestry Commission
office, Sorrells said.

Residents can't afford to become complacent about wildfires, said Jonathan
Daniell, director of Ware County's Emergency Management Agency.

"I think people look at it more seriously now when we say evacuate because of
the fires last year," Daniell said.

Wildfire evacuees bounced back and forth between their homes, relatives and
emergency shelters almost daily last year as shifting winds continually changed
the path of the flames.

Beginning in March, emergency management officials will offer public service
reminders about wildfire danger and warnings to not become complacent, he said.

Not all the wildfires were accidental. Among others, seven deliberately set
blazes destroyed nearly 700 acres in Berrien County, officials said.

The Georgia Arson Control reporting program that pays rewards up to $10,000 in
arson cases will be continued, state Fire Commissioner John Oxendine said.

Oxendine and Sorrells characterized the reward program as an effective tool in
the overall effort to prevent wildfires.

ARSON HOT LINE

People should call the arson hot line if they see someone suspicious in the
woods or leaving the area when a fire breaks out, or if they have information
about someone starting a woods fire, Oxendine said.

"We want [would-be arsonists] to know that we are out there and have people
watching you, so don't set that fire," Sorrells said.

To report an arson of a building, vehicle, woods or other property, call (800)
282-5804.

Death toll from fires reaches 10

Crews discovered more bodies as they searched the rubble of wildfires that
torched hundreds of homes and businesses near Great Smoky Mountains National
Park, bringing the death toll to 11, officials said Thursday.

Authorities set up a hotline for people to report missing friends and relatives,
and after following up on dozens of leads, they said many of those people had
been accounted for. They did not say whether they believe anyone else is still
missing.

Search-and-rescue missions continued until dark, but Gatlinburg Fire Chief Greg
Miller said that since it had been three days since the fires, "... it could be
more of a recovery than a rescue."

Nearly 24 hours of rain on Wednesday helped dampen the wildfires, but fire
officials said months of drought have left the ground bone dry and the wildfires
could rekindle.

Buzz Aldrin evacuated from South Pole - An ailing Buzz Aldrin, the second man to
walk on the moon, was evacuated from the South Pole to New Zealand where he was
hospitalized Thursday in stable condition.

Aldrin, 86, was visiting Antarctica as a tourist when he fell ill. He was flown
to Christchurch from McMurdo Station, a U.S. research center on the Antarctic
coast.

Tour company White Desert said Aldrin has fluid in his lungs, but was responding
well to antibiotics. He'll remain hospitalized overnight for observation. His
manager Christina Korp, who accompanied him, said he was in good spirits.

SWAT team rescues hostages at credit union - Authorities said a gunman
threatened some of the 11 people held hostage at a Jacksonville, Fla., credit
union before they were rescued by SWAT team members.

Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said that after the suspect on Thursday put
his gun to the back of the head of one hostage, SWAT team members had resolved
to storm the bank at the first opportunity.

Williams said that moment came when two people who had been hiding inside the
bank made a run for it, distracting the gunman. SWAT team members then rushed
into the Community First Credit Union and put themselves between the suspect and
hostages, according to the sheriff.

Williams said the suspect is in custody.

Big game animals killed, left to rot - Wildlife officers say someone shot and
killed 11 big game animals in eastern Colorado and left the carcasses to rot.

Colorado Parks and Wildlife said Thursday that nine antelope and two deer were
killed with firearms Nov. 11-12 near the town of Seibert, about 130 miles east
of Denver.

Spokesman Kyle Davidson says it's one of the most egregious poaching cases the
agency has seen in some time.

Neither animal was in season for rifle hunting. Even in season, abandoning a
carcass is illegal.

Parents disarm teen who fired gun in class - Two fast-acting parents disarmed
their 15-year-old son at a Utah junior high school Thursday after they noticed
the teenager acting peculiarly in the morning and realized he had taken the
family's shotgun and handgun, police said.

The mother and father arrived shortly after the boy entered a classroom in the
northern Utah city of Bountiful and fired one round into the ceiling, injuring
no one but leaving a hole the size of a small plate, Bountiful Police Chief Tom
Ross said.

The boy didn't say a word as a teacher and one of 26 students tried to talk him
out of firing again, giving his parents time to arrive at the classroom and take
him into the hallway, Ross said.

The chief declined to provide specifics on what the parents noticed about the
teen's behavior.

Global warming intensifying wildfires?

BYLINE: Joe Bauman Deseret Morning News

LENGTH: 549 words


Utah and other western states are in the throes of more frequent, longer-burning
and more intense wildfires caused by global warming, according to a research
report published Thursday.

The report added that this human-influenced disaster may only worsen.

"To me, this is the equivalent of what hurricanes are for the southeast coast,"
said Steven W. Running, professor of ecology at the University of Montana in
Missoula. "This is a natural disaster that we've always lived with periodically,
and now we see for the first time evidence that global warming is accelerating
the regularity and intensity of these wildfires."

The report, titled "Warming and Earlier Spring Increases Western U.S. Forest
Wildfire Activity," was published in the latest edition of Science Express, the
weekly journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Its
authors are Anthony L. Westerling, Hugo G. Hidalgo and Daniel R. Cayan of the
Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., and Thomas W. Swetnam
of the University of Arizona in Tucson.

Running wrote an accompanying opinion piece, "Is Global Warming Causing More,
Larger Wildfires?"

The research report noted that while increases in western forest wildfires have
been observed in recent years, the extent of the changes hasn't been documented
until now, and climate's role in the changes weren't previously established.

The researchers compiled a database of 1,166 large wildfires that have struck
the West from 1970 through 2003, comparing them to climate and other data. They
concluded that large wildfires "increased suddenly and dramatically in the
mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations and
longer wildfire seasons."

The greatest increases were in midelevation forests in the northern Rocky
Mountains and are "strongly associated with increased spring and summer
temperatures and an earlier snowmelt," the report said.

If summer droughts increase in western mountains, more large wildfires will
reduce the trees, the report said. That means fewer trees will be available to
absorb carbon dioxide, a pollutant many scientists blame for global warming.
Meanwhile, if fires continue to worsen, they will release more carbon to the
air, according to the report.

That suggests the forests in the West "may become a source of increased
atmospheric carbon dioxide," the report added, "even under a relatively modest
temperature-increase scenario."

Why is the West especially in danger from the changes?

The rest of the nation gets enough summer rainfall that "they just aren't as dry
during the heat of the summer as we are," Running said in a telephone interview
Thursday. "What little summer rainfall we get evaporates within hours to a few
days."

That doesn't do much to "rehydrate the forest," Running said.

The best climate models he knows about say that in western North America, summer
temperatures should increase between 2 degrees and 5 degrees in the next 50 or
60 years.

"What I find critical there is, the Westerling paper already shows this level of
wildfire activity with only 0.9 degree increase," Running said. "If we have
another 2- or 3-degree increase on top of that, we can imagine a doubling or
more in the wildfire activity and burn area in the coming decades." E-mail:

Washington: Walden calls on administration to address wildfire funding, forest
management reform

LENGTH: 782  words



Washington: Office of the MP Greg Walden has issued the following news release:

 We write to call your immediate attention to the damage catastrophic wildfires
cause to our communities, States, national forests and other public lands
throughout the country.


The National Interagency Fire Center reports that there have been 49,563 fires
that burned 8,422,251 acres so far in 2017.  According to the U.S. Forest
Service (FS), another 80 million acres throughout the country are currently
considered high risk. The FS has expended more than $2.3 billion to fight fires
in fiscal year 2017 alone - a new record.  The House Committee on Natural
Resources reports that in 2016, wildfires destroyed 4,312 structures, including
3,192 residences.

The House Committee on Natural Resources also stated, "Despite data from the FS
indicating that active forest management reduces wildfire intensity and improves
forest health, only 1 to 2% of high risk areas are treated." In fact, the
Committee has reported that hazardous fuels are accumulating three times as fast
as they can be treated and that the FS only harvested 2.5 billion board feet in
2016 compared to over 10 billion board feet in 1990. To make matters worse,
litigation and other challenges have caused a significant reduction in active
saw mills nationwide, from 1,311 in 1995 to just over 220 today.
Catastrophic fires also cause significant damage to the environment. Robust data
from NASA has concluded that one catastrophic wildfire can emit more carbon
emissions in a few days than total vehicle emissions in an entire state over the
course of a year. As a result of recent wildfires, Seeley Lake, Montana set a
record for the worst air quality ever recorded there - 18 times greater than
EPA's safe particle limit. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce recently
reported, "In 2005 alone, wildfires resulted in more than 126 million tons of
carbon dioxide in the United States."
Rep. Westerman and Ken Fisher recently pointed out that Congress authorized
approximately $120 billion for Hurricane Katrina and $50 billion for Hurricane
Sandy relief. Meanwhile, the entire 2016 budget for the Forest Service was $7.1
billion. More than half of these funds went to put out wildfires. Catastrophic
wildfires are horrific disasters and should be responded to as such - much the
same way that we as a nation are currently confronting the incredible
devastation wrought by Hurricanes Maria, Harvey and Irma.
Eight times in the last twelve years, the FS has moved funds from other
operating accounts to fight fire, depleting accounts for forest management in
the process that would help prevent catastrophic wildfires. This flawed approach
causes us to spend billions of dollars on the backend to suppress fire,
neglecting fire prevention and putting our communities at increasing risk of
catastrophic fire. This is a treatable problem, and one which we understand the
causes of very well.
Healthy forest advocates support solutions like Rep. Westerman's bipartisan H.R.
2936, Resilient Federal Forests Act and Reps. Simpson and Schrader's bipartisan
H.R. 2862, the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act. H.R. 2936 is comprehensive
legislation that simplifies the cumbersome planning process and reduces the cost
of implementing proactive forest management strategies. The bill adopts a
forward-thinking, active management strategy that combats dangerous wildfires
before they get started and includes reforms that would end the practice of fire
borrowing. H.R. 2862 would change how we budget for the costs of suppressing
catastrophic wildfires to conform to the method we use to budget for other
natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tornados. This reform seeks to ensure
resources are available to fight catastrophic wildfires without raiding accounts
that prevent these fires in the first place.
Mismanagement has left our forests vulnerable to insects and disease and ripe
for catastrophic wildfires. The system is broken. We need forest management
reforms, and we need them now. We ask that you work with us to help to fix the
way we manage our forests and how we pay for wildfire disasters. Two goals we
can all agree on are reducing the costs of these fires and breaking out of this
destructive, nationwide wildfire cycle.
Accordingly, we ask that the Administration send Congress a proposal that
includes comprehensive forest management and wildland fire budgeting reforms as
part of the next disaster relief request as soon as possible. We look forward to
working with you to resolve these long-standing issues for the benefit of the
American people and to ensure our natural resource heritage is sustained for
future generations.

Firefighters gain ground in Gilroy wildfire      As of 7 a.m. Wednesday,
containment of the blaze  dubbed the Ballybunion Fire  was at 65 percent, up
from 20 percent Tuesday night, according to Cal Fire spokeswoman Pam Temmermand.
No structures have been damaged or threatened.

The fire has remained at 100 acres burned since Monday.

The fire at the Eagle Ridge housing development in west Gilroy was reported at
7:10 p.m. Sunday and quickly spread. Nearly 300 firefighters, along with three
helicopters and 33 engines, are battling the blaze, according to Cal Fire.

Authorities do not yet know how the blaze started.

The fire has been particularly challenging to fight because of the hilly terrain
and heavy underbrush, Temmermand said.

One injury has been reported. On Sunday night, a firefighter lost his footing
and fell about 40 feet. He was taken to St. Louise Regional Hospital for an
evaluation and released.

WILDFIRE SEASON AWARENESS

The Florida Forest Service reminds North Florida residents of Wildfire Awareness
Week (Sunday-April 12), recognizing the state's devastating 1998 wildfire season
when more than 500,000 acres and 337 homes and buildings were damaged or
destroyed by wildfires.

Spring is the most active time during Florida's year-round wildfire season with
dry, windy weather and increased springtime yard debris burns leading to higher
wildfire activity. While there has been some excess rainfall, increased wildfire
activity is predicted if foliage starts to dry out, Florida Forest Service
wildfire mitigation specialist Annaleasa Winter said.

State officials warn residents to always use caution when burning yard debris.
Officials also remind residents that fires must be at least 25 feet from forests
and homes, 50 feet from a paved public road and 150 feet from other occupied
buildings.

Aug. 06--EDMOND -- UPDATE: A two-story home continues to burn at 10 p.m.
Saturday, with the flames visible from Interstate 35 and Covell, where fire
officials said about 1,000 acres of property has been scorched Saturday by a
rekindled wildfire. The massive wildfire shifted with the wind stirred up by an
early evening thunderstorm, creating severe challenges for firefighters. The
almost 1-inch of rain helped cool off the city, but was not enough to put out
the wildfire's hottest spots Saturday night.

At 10:07 p.m., the Oklahoma Highway Patrol announced that Interstate 35 from
Waterloo Road to Second Street was back open. The northbound and southbound
lanes were closed earlier in the afternoon due to extremely poor visability from
the smoke generated by the wildfire. Hundreds of motorists were diverted into
Edmond city limits, left to find alternate routes while public safety officials
struggled to limit property damage from the fires.

UPDATE: City spokeswoman Ashleigh Clark reported that Saturday's massive
wildfire has claimed six homes and at least 12 outbuildings. At 9 p.m. Saturday,
firefighters continue to battle the wildfire that rekindled near Interstate 35
and Sorghum Mill Road earlier in the day.

Clark said the fire at one point also threatened Fire Station No. 5 at
Interstate 35 and Covell, which also houses the Fire Department's training
facility and the Children's Safety Village. In the same city complex, to the
south of the fire station, are the Edmond Animal Shelter and the Crosstimbers
Municipal Complex, which is home to the Edmond Electric and Edmond Public Works
headquarters. Clark said the city did not have to evacuate animals or personnel
from the animal shelter.

Meanwhile, the American Red Cross and the City of Edmond have opened a family
reunification center at the Downtown Community Center, 28 E. Main St. A Red
Cross representative will be at this location to help families assess needs and
provide support. Rusty Surette, Red Cross spokesman, said this site is not
serving as a shelter, but only as a needs assessment center at this point.

UPDATE: The Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office is asking Edmond residents to only
call 911 if they see flying embers or fire as metro-area firefighters battle a
massive wildfire threatening East Edmond.

Mark Meyers, Oklahoma County Sheriff's spokesman, stated that residents have
been calling 911 from all areas of the county to report sightings of smoke from
the large blaze that has shut down a portion of Interstate 35 in Edmond. He said
the phone calls are tying up emergency phone lines.

Meyers said the biggest portion of the blaze is being battled in the area of
Interstate 35 and East Sorghum Mill Road to East Air Depot and Northeast 206th
Street.

UPDATE: Dena Bleeker is fleeing her home shortly before 8 p.m. tonight ahead of
the flames from a massive wildfire threatening east Edmond. Public safety
officials are asking residents to leave that addition as they try to contain a
wildfire that has jumped Air Depot to the east in several spots.

"It's very smoky here," Bleeker said via her cell phone as she left her
driveway. "There's big, gray/black smoke."

Redbud Canyon is along Covell at Douglas Boulevard in East Edmond. While Bleeker
has not seen any flames yet, many other Edmond residents have fled ahead of the
flames that rekindled near Sorghum Mill Road earlier this afternoon from
Thursday's wildfire.

UPDATE: Firefighters from across the metro area are fighting a fast-moving
wildfire that is forcing neighborhoods near East Edmond to evacuate.

Lt. Chris West of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol said Interstate 35 from Waterloo
Road to Second Street was shut down to traffic due to heavy smoke hampering
visibility. He said visibility was down to about a half-mile.

Officials believe Saturday's wildfire is rekindled from a large wildfire tamped
down on Thursday.

Public safety officials are blocking the intersections of Covell and Air Depot
and Coffee Creek and Air Depot and not allowing travel mostly to the north and
east from those two areas due to the fire.

Flames and smoke are visible from multiple areas across the city, observers have
reported.

Even slightest increase in average temperature could bring dramatic rise in
wildfire activities

BYLINE: Natalia Hall

LENGTH: 306  words


Experts have raised concerns by unveiling that extreme wildfires are taking
place in the Western United States. The blazes are more violent and taking place
at more frequent levels in recent years than they have in the past. New research
has blamed global warming for the same.

A novel research has a reason as to why wildfires in the Western United States
have been taking places more frequently and why they have become more violent
than at any point in the past. As per them, it is happening due to global
warming.

Researchers from the University of Wyoming has warned that the world has reached
at such a level that even a slightest increase in average temperature can lead
to dramatic increase in wildlife activity.

The researchers also said that global warming may be bringing alterations and
ushering in an era of high-elevation wildfires that have not been seen in over
1,000 years. Owing to climate change, more than 50,000 wildfires have taken
place.

As per the researchers, the wildfires have burnt more than 9 million acres in
the West and Alaska this year. The researchers said that warming in Alaska is
the major reason behind massive wildfires there this year.

The researchers have gone through charcoal samples representing 2,000 years of
wildfire. The samples have been taken from lake beds in a subalpine forest in
northern Colorado's Mount Zirkel Wilderness near Steamboat Springs.

"Our study then adds more evidence that the recent increase in large wildfires
is related to climate change because the only time we see these types of large
wildfires in the last 2,000 years is when we had a similar amount of warming",
said study's lead researcher John Calder.

"We don't know how the other mountain ranges burned in the region, but expanding
this study into other mountain ranges is something I would like to do," Calder
said.

Region: Group warns of air pollution from more frequent wildfires

BYLINE: By John Myers Duluth News Tribune

SECTION: BREAKING; Wisconsin; Minnesota-Twin Cities; State

LENGTH: 478 words


As huge swaths of Australia burn in wildfires spurred by drought, health experts
in the U.S. warned Thursday that more heat and more fires means more unhealthy
air to breathe.

The Natural Resources Defense Council released a list of 31 states -- including
Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa -- that saw air quality degraded in 2011 because
of smoke from wildfires, some of them within the state and others far away.

The report concluded that climate change is spurring more heat, more drought and
more wildfires that are leading to unhealthy air.

"Even if you don't live near wildfires your health may be affected by their
smoke," Kim Knowlton, a senior scientist with NRDC's Health and Environment
Program, said in a teleconference Thursday.

The NRDC report, using 2011 data, ranked Texas as the state with the most people
exposed to a week or more of bad air from wildfire smoke. Minnesota ranked 20th,
with 15,000 people exposed to nearby smoke and some 1.6 million people affected
by distant smoke. Wisconsin ranked 23rd and Iowa 10th.

In 2011, fueled by a dry summer and drought that lingered into autumn, several
major wildfires burned across northern Minnesota, including the Pagami Creek
fire in the Superior National Forest, the state's largest wildfire in at least
80 years. Smoke from that fire was tracked as far away as Chicago.

The study found some 212 million people across the nation were exposed to
wildfire smoke in 2011. The NRDC said it was the first time the health effects
of wildfire smoke had been mapped using satellite data from the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.

Wildfire smoke contains dozens of toxic compounds, but it's fine particles that
can enter lungs that are the most problematic, said Dr. Patrick L. Kinney,
professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University's Mailman
School of Public Health.

Kinney said smoke from fires hundreds, even thousands of miles away may be an
issue. In northern Minnesota, for example, residents often report smelling smoke
from distant fires in Canada.

"If you can smell it ... or see the haze, I'd be concerned from a health point
of view," Kinney told the News Tribune. "Even globally, fine particulate matter
can move thousands of miles."

The health experts urged fast action to limit greenhouse gas emissions and slow
climate change to cut back on the number of wildfires that are spurred by long
hot and dry weather patterns some experts say are linked to climate change. They
said there is no system to track how many people have become ill from wildfire
smoke, or deaths related to smoke exposure.

Other states with large populations in areas affected by smoky conditions for a
week or more include Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New
Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee.

Washington: Global Warming: Wildfires at All-Time Low

LENGTH: 144  words


The Heartland Institute has issued the following news release:

The number of wildfires in the United States is at an all-time low this year,
the National Interagency Fire Center reports. The number of total acres burned
is at its second lowest on record.

The wildfire data contradict alarmist assertions that global warming is causing
more wildfires. National Interagency Fire Center data show the number of U.S.
wildfires has been in decline for the past 40 years.
Of course, wildfires have always been a part of nature and always will be,
regardless of whether the planet warms or cools. Global warming alarmists like
to pounce on the wildfires that still occur and claim they are caused by global
warming. Objective data, however, show that wildfires are becoming less frequent
as our planet modestly warms.

Reconnaissance is half the battle Satellite, software help combat wildfire
threat

BYLINE: Carl Laundrie Staff Writer

SECTION: A; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 745  words


Firefighters know a key to their success is getting people and equipment to
trouble spots in a hurry.

They're more likely to be comfortable at the controls of their hardware than a
computer's software. But a new computer program being prepared for use by the
state Division of Forestry will make a computer mouse a mighty tool.

The new Fire Risk Assessment System takes high-resolution satellite imagery of
the entire state, plugs in everything Forestry knows about the types of
vegetation, wildfire fuels, weather and population and marries it on one screen.

After 20 years on the job, Mike Kuypers, a forestry district supervisor, knows a
lot about wildfire. He knows the trouble spots, the vegetation, local weather
patterns and what a wildfire is likely to do.

Forestry doesn't want to replace that knowledge, but a new computer software
package could put it at the fingertips of any dispatcher, land planner,
firefighter or government employee concerned about wildfires.

Kuypers, whose district includes Volusia and Flagler counties, was here for the
1985 wildfires that destroyed 130 homes in Flagler County and again in 1998 when
about 370 homes were destroyed or damaged statewide by wildfires.

Hoping to avoid the situation in the future, one of the recommendations from a
committee appointed to study the fires by then Gov. Lawton Chiles focused on
developing a means to give managers a strategic view of the state's wildfire
risk to help prevent loss of life and property.

The Division of Forestry contracted with Space Imaging Solutions of Salt Lake
City, Utah. Teams of foresters were sent out to 3,000 plots throughout the state
to assess vegetation, the amount of wildfire fuel, topography and other factors.

"What we feel we have is a fuels map that is 90 percent accurate," Kuypers said.

The computer map breaks the state into quarter-acre pixels that are shaded
various colors to match the type of vegetation and conditions that exist in that
quarter-acre area. Included in that information is weather history for 18
regions based on the Forestry district maps, soil types, roads, buildings and
other information.

When a wildfire is reported, dispatchers log the location in the system and it
reports the type of terrain and vegetation near the fire, where it might go and
what kind of a threat it poses.

It also is handy for planning, Kuypers said.

"You can play 'what-if' games with it," Kuypers said. "You can go in and ask: If
I control burn this area, what will the risk of wildfire be in a year? In two
years?"

Foresters conduct what are called "controlled burns." Started and controlled by
Forestry personnel under ideal conditions, the goal is to burn off underbrush
and dead vegetation buildup and increase wildfire danger.

The program will help identify high-risk areas that need to be burned.

"There is always 10 times more burning that needs to be done than gets done in a
year," Kuypers said.

An example of the odds facing Forestry trying to keep wildfire danger at a safe
level can be summed up in manpower and machines versus the land. There are 20
rangers and 10 tractors to conduct yearly controlled burns and fight wildfires
on 530,000 acres of wildlands in Volusia County and 270,000 in Flagler County.

"In a situation like 1998, we bring in others to help out," Kuypers said. "Just
like a city fire department, we can't staff for the worst-case scenario."

The computer system is available to Forestry District offices throughout the
state now. However, its supervisors, Kuypers included, are just learning how to
use the system.

"We are looking at an interim training period and we will launch the system in
about 60 days," Jim Karels, with the Division of Forestry in Tallahassee, said.

Soon after that, Forestry dispatchers will have the new computer system.
Forestry offices throughout the state are upgrading their computer systems to
handle the new program.

Karels said the system was funded by a Federal Emergency Management Agency Grant
of about $600,000. The grant paid for the computer system and the work Forestry
put into the system gathering information.

The new computer program has pointed some problems for Volusia and Flagler
counties.

"It shows the areas burned in 1998 are coming back," Kuypers said. "Some are in
the high-hazard range again."

Would it have made a difference in 1998?

"It wouldn't have stopped the fires," Kuypers said, "but if we had it previous
to 1998, it might have helped as a planning tool."

WOODED LOTS ADD FIRE RISK COMMISSION OFFERS HOME PROTECTION TIPS

BYLINE: By Rob Pavey Staff Writer

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 366 words


The growing appeal of large, wooded lots in Richmond and Columbia counties puts
more and more property at risk of damage by wildfires, according to Richmond
County's senior forester.

"In this area, many more people are starting to build homes in the woods," said
Cathy Black of the Georgia Forestry Commission's Spirit Creek Educational Forest
in Richmond County. "When we have wildfires, these are the homes that are most
susceptible."

According to commission records, Richmond County had 42 wildfires during the
2004 fire season.

Three vehicles were destroyed, and 125 homes and buildings were threatened. In
Columbia County, 38 wildfires were reported, threatening 71 homes and buildings.

The commission is offering a series of educational programs in Richmond and
Columbia counties this month aimed at helping homeowners living near wooded
areas reduce the risk of wildfire.

"In this area, wildfires occur in the winter, and right now is our wildfire
season," Ms. Black said. "We see most of our most dangerous wildfires from
January to April."

Although many people believe the summer months are more prone to fires, the low
humidity of cold months and the abundance of dead vegetation make fires more
likely in winter.

Foresters are offering a free program to groups interested in learning about
wildfire prevention and protection, Ms. Black said.

"It's all about ways to fireproof a home - keeping gutters clean and sweeping
off roofs and getting rid of overhanging branches," she said.

Leaving green-space buffers around homes in wooded areas and proper irrigation
and landscaping also can reduce wildfire risks, she said.

"We are offering a new service where we can present these programs - 30 minutes
or one hour - to groups free of charge," she said.

The Firewise program is part of a national effort to insulate homes from
wildfire damage.

"If a community is interested in this, we can come out, do a walk through their
area and point out fire hazards and even help them develop a plan for fire
prevention and evacuation," she said.

Anyone interested in the program can call the Spirit Creek Educational Forest at
(706) 790-2351.

Program highlights wildfire preparedness

BYLINE: Jasen Lee Deseret News

LENGTH: 556 words


SALT LAKE CITY ? Keeping homes safe from wildfires takes planning that could
potentially prevent tragedy in the long run. So far this year, there have been
340 reported wildfires in Utah that have burned nearly 11,000 acres.

As demonstrated this year in Colorado, wildfires can be deadly and destructive,
but understanding and preparing for fires can save lives and property. With
another intense wildfire season predicted for Utah and the Intermountain West,
the Natural History Museum of Utah has opened a new exhibit examining the role
of wildfires in forest ecology and the relationship between humans and wildfires
. ?Nature Unleashed: Wildfire? examines the powerful natural force that is
particularly relevant to life in the West. The feature is open to the public
from noon to 4 p.m. Saturday and is part of a long-running ?Nature Unleashed?
exhibition at the museum that analyzes six types of nature disasters:
earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, hurricanes, tornadoes and wildfires. In Utah,
wildfires are typically the most frequently occurring natural event, according
to Tyre Holfeltz, state wildland urban interface coordinator, who spoke at the
exhibit Friday. A wildland urban interface is an area where homes are built near
or among lands prone to wildland fire. For years, most wildland fires were
ignited by lightning, but recently more fires have been sparked by humans,
Holfeltz explained, including 222 fires thus far in 2013. While preventing all
wildfires is nearly impossible, there are steps to take to protect people and
property, he said. ?You can add plants to your landscapes that will stay greener
longer, therefore increasing the resiliency of your property and your home,?
Holfeltz said. Installing fire-resistant roof shingles, double- or triple-pane
windows can help the spread of fire as well, he said. Storing gas cans or yard
equipment like mowers or snowblowers away from the house or attached garage is
also an effective preventive measure. ?We look at our (wood) fences, 'Are they
touching the house?'" Holfeltz queried rhetorically. ?If they are, then what can
be done to mitigate that?? Simply putting a large piece of sheet metal between
the fence and the house to ?create a very thin barrier? is a practical
preventive measure, he said. However, one of the easiest and most effective
solutions to wildfire prevention for urban areas is removing potentially
dangerous vegetation near houses that could provide fuel for flames. Fires have
shaped the West and are a natural part of its ecosystem, said Salt Lake City
firefighter Aaron Lightfoot. But having a fire suppression plan in place in the
event of a blaze is an important part of any household emergency plan. ?If you
live on the urban interface, then you need to have a defensible space between
(your home) and the natural foliage that comes down from the mountainside,?
Lightfoot said. Having about 30 feet of open space is a good working distance
that would provide a measure of safety, he explained, and would give
firefighters the room needed to battle flames that might be encroaching toward
homes and property. ?The defensible space is your biggest protection against
fire danger,? he said. ?If we see the fire coming, we can set up on all sides of
your house to start the fire fight.? Email: jlee@deseretnews.com Twitter:

Dry, hot summer didn't spark more wildfires in the province; Post-Fort McMurray
rule changes kept total well below five-year average: official

BYLINE: Shawn Logan, Edmonton Journal

SECTION: CITY; Pg. A9

LENGTH: 474 words

Despite a sizzling summer that left much of the province tinder dry, Alberta
largely dodged a bullet when it comes to devastating wildfires, with far fewer
in 2017 than normal.

Coming off a pair of rough years for wildfires in Alberta that included last
year's Fort McMurray wildfire, which scorched 600,000 hectares and forced 88,000
people to flee their homes, the province this year recorded 237 fewer fires in
its wildfire management areas than the five-year average of 1,391.

While two of Alberta's largest blazes this year - the late-summer Kenow fire,
which swept through Waterton Lakes National Park, and the stubborn Verdant Creek
fire near Banff - occurred on federal land, even when combined with wildfires in
Alberta wildfire management areas, the amount of land burned was a mere fraction
of the area charred in the previous two years.

Alberta Wildfire spokeswoman Melissa Crawford said a combination of luck, timing
and legislative changes prompted by last year's massive Fort McMurray blaze may
have spared the province.

"We've gotten quite lucky this year," Crawford said. "We actually had some
pretty helpful weather conditions this year and we've also implemented some
legislative changes that have helped."

The province was still battling 17 wildfires in wildfire management areas
throughout Alberta this week while the Kenow and Verdant Creek fires are both
considered to be held.

To date, some 45,400 hectares of Alberta Crown land has been lost to wildfires,
although that doesn't include the combined 55,000 hectares scorched by the Kenow
and Verdant Creek fires.

Even so, it's a far cry from the 611,000 hectares of provincial Crown land
burned in 2016, and the 471,000 hectares in the previous year.

After the Fort McMurray blaze, the province hiked fines for people who ignore
fire bans to as high as $100,000 from $5,000. Corporations that once would have
to pay as little as $5,000 may now face a penalty of $1 million.

Crawford said after the fines were increased in February, the province has
noticed significantly more compliance during fire bans, which the province
believes may have helped reduce the fire threat.

She added that lessons learned in the aftermath of Fort McMurray prompted the
province to take another look at its fire prevention strategies.

"We put a lot of prevention resources in place and that helped lower the number
of fires this year," Crawford said.

Also helping was a relatively wet spring - traditionally the most dangerous
period for Alberta wildfires.

Crawford said while the wildfire season is winding down, those heading for the
backcountry in summer's waning days should still take precautions.

"We are never fully out of the woods," she said, "but we are looking at the
downside now." slogan@postmedia.com twitter.com/ShawnLogan403 !@COPYRIGHT=© 2017

Washington: Western Senators, Secretary of Ag Agree: Wildfire Funding Must be
Fixed Now

LENGTH: 757  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Jim Risch has issued the following news
release:

A bipartisan group of western senators pushing for their legislation to fix
"fire borrowing" heard strong evidence from Secretary of Agriculture Sonny
Perdue and fire experts at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S.
Forest Service that Congress should pass their bill to end fire borrowing.


The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, introduced by Sens. Mike Crapo, Jim Risch,
Ron Wyden, D-Ore. and Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and five other bipartisan
senators, would treat wildfires as natural disasters and stop the erosion of the
Forest Service's budget by reforming the way the federal government funds
wildfires. The legislation would end "fire borrowing," which has depleted funds
intended for forest restoration, habitat programs, trail maintenance and fire
prevention programs, such as thinning. More than 250 private and public
organizations have supported the legislation.
Crapo, Risch, Wyden Bennet attended a Washington, D.C. briefing today where the
Forest Service announced all-time record spending of more than $2 billion to pay
to fight this year's wildfires, which have destroyed significant parts of the
West. Once again, the senators noted, federal agencies have had to empty
non-fire accounts of more than a half-billion dollars to pay for wildfires. More
than 8.5 million acres have burned across the country this year - a 47 percent
increase from the 10-year average of 5.8 million acres. The emergency
preparedness levels for fire are at the highest point in five years.
"We already know in the West about the devastation of these wildfires on our
habitat, our lungs, and on our heritage," Crapo said.  "Hopefully, now our
colleagues in the Senate will see the magnitude and immediacy of this problem
and end this 'fire borrowing' so that we can focus on fire prevention and focus
on saving lives, habitat and our favorite public lands places for the future."

"Wildfires are a catastrophic event just like an earthquake, hurricane, or
tornado. But there is one very big difference - wildfires are at least partially
preventable and almost fully manageable," Risch said. "If we set aside funds for
wildfire prevention ahead of time, we can actually tamper down the destruction.
This is what our legislation seeks to accomplish."
"My colleagues and I heard the message loud and clear today from Sec. Perdue:
the federal government cannot keep conducting 'business as usual' when it comes
to fire funding," Wyden said. "This year's devastating fires underscore the
urgency of this issue. Fixing this broken fire budgeting system is a bipartisan
idea and has been from the start. We're calling on Congress to pass our
bipartisan bill to end fire borrowing, stop the Forest Service from becoming the
'Fire Service' and start treating wildfires like the natural disasters they
are."
"Today's briefing on the historical cost of this year's wildfire season
emphasized the importance of changing the way we pay for fighting catastrophic
fires," Bennet said. "It was good to hear from Secretary Perdue about the
immediate need to end the penny wise, pound foolish practice of fire borrowing,
ensuring the Forest Service can do its job to mitigate future fires. The
opportunity to sit down with my colleagues and the Secretary to discuss the
Wildfire Disaster Funding Act of 2017 is a testament to the bipartisan interest
in passing this critical legislation."
The bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would fund wildfires as natural
disasters and protect the agencies' fire prevention budgets by putting a freeze
on the rising budget costs of the 10-year average. It would end "fire borrowing"
by allowing the agencies to fund any fire suppression spending needed above the
frozen average through disaster funding just like other agencies can access
disaster funding for tornadoes, hurricanes and floods. It would also make room
for wildfires in the disaster budget so other natural disasters would not have
to "compete" for disaster funds.
Making disaster funding available after the appropriated fire suppression
funding is spent would allow the Forest Service to use its fire prevention
funding for its intended purpose - completing hazardous fuels reduction projects
that have been shown to help break the cycle of increasingly dangerous and
costly fires.
Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Cory Gardner, R-Colo., also cosponsored the bill.

   Introduction

 Regionally, nationally and globally, threats to life, property and resources
from wildfire are growing. Changing climate conditions, growth of vulnerable
communities into high-hazard areas, and limited governmental and financial
resources available to cope with this threat all mean that wildfire losses are
expected to continue and expand. It is not possible to find a single and simple
solution to all of the problems that the scenario of larger, damaging wildfire
presents. However, when focusing on how to prevent wildland/urban interface
(WUI) fire disasters - the destruction of dozens or hundreds of structures
during significant wildfire events - researchers and safety advocates have
discovered solutions in the form of voluntary community action to reduce
wildfire risks around homes and neighborhoods, and in sound design and
construction standards that can be adopted and applied by state and local
governments.

   National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) Firewise program provides a
sustainable solution to the growing trend of home losses during wildland fires.
n1 The Firewise Communities/USA(R) Recognition Program provides the process for
WUI residents and a model for behavior change that effectively reduces the risk
of home - and thus community - ignitions. n2 The program has been growing
steadily since its inception fifteen years ago. n3 In this paper, we will
examine the development of Firewise communities and how they have expanded
nationally and in the state of Arizona. We will also  [*182]  examine
Arizona-based success stories resulting from the embrace of Firewise principles
at the community level.

   To understand how to prevent WUI disasters, one must understand how homes
ignite and burn during a wildfire. This paper will cover the most current
research and evidence on this topic, and the surprisingly simple techniques that
can be used by property owners to prevent home ignitions.

   Finally, we will examine why regulation and zoning ordinances are also an
important component in the equation to find a solution to this growing wildfire
"menace." A helpful study produced by the Fire Protection Research Foundation,
Community Wildfire Safety through Regulation, n4 will be explored. We will
introduce information on NFPA design and construction standards that can be
adopted in whole or in part by communities as components of local building and
fire codes. We will conclude by demonstrating how planning and zoning tools have
great potential to be effective in risk reduction in the event of a wildfire.

   I. The Scope and Magnitude of the WUI Disaster Problem

 Wildland fire in Arizona and the United States is increasingly a problem of
home destruction when nature's fire moves from grasses, brush, and trees into
settlements and subdivisions, igniting urban conflagrations. When homes are at
risk from destruction due to wildfire, they are said to exist in "the
wildland/urban interface." n5 An imperfect descriptor, the wildland/urban
interface (WUI) is the name our society gives to try to indicate the risk of
homes in or near areas where the natural vegetation is prone to burning from
wildfire. n6 A better definition of this problem focuses less on the "where,"
and more on the "how" homes ignite and burn.

   The National Fire Protection Association's Firewise program n7 has long
described the WUI home destruction phenomenon as "a set of conditions under
which a wildland fire reaches beyond trees, brush and other natural fuels to
ignite homes and their immediate surroundings." n8 The set of conditions that
allow homes to burn can exist almost anywhere in the nation,  [*183]  and is
certainly prevalent in the Western U.S. Property loss due to this set of
conditions is on an exponential growth trend both nationwide and in Arizona due
to a number of factors. n9

   Of the 2.3 billion acres of land in the U.S., 1 billion acres are categorized
as government (federal, state and local) and privately owned wildlands, or areas
essentially without structures. n10 In addition to these 1 billion acres of
"wildlands," each state forester has designated developed areas at high risk
from wildfire, totaling more than 220 million acres, or twice the area of
California. n11



   This is not a static figure. Increased development near wildlands is
ever-accelerating the continued growth of the wildland/urban interface. Since
1990, the U.S. has experienced an unprecedented conversion-growth rate of 3
acres per minute, 4000 acres per day and close to 2 million acres per year of
conversion from undeveloped "wildlands" to wildland/urban interface. n12

 Population growth and migration to the south and west is driving the growth of
the WUI. "The population growth of 32.7 million people between 1990 and 2000
represents the largest census-to-census increase in American history," with the
highest growth rates in the West. n13 The first decade of the new millennium saw
a slower rate of growth at 9.7 percent, but this still represented 27.3 million
more people, with much higher growth rates in the South (14.3) and the West
(13.8) than other regions. n14 Arizona was the second-fastest growing state
during both decades (following Nevada), adding more than 2.7 million people over
twenty years. n15

   Much of this new development has taken place and continues to flourish in
areas of historic fire occurrence and within ecosystems in which plant and
animal species are fire-adapted or fire-dependent. Ongoing drought  [*184]
conditions, n16 overgrown forests and rangelands, n17 as well as changing
climatic conditions n18 all contribute to fire conditions and the potential for
more damaging wildfires than in past decades. In addition to population growth
and migration pressures, there is little disincentive for development in
wildfire-prone areas. n19 In fact, the rugged, rural nature of many fire-prone
locales is what attracts many residents in the first place. n20 Risk mapping and
regulation have not been applied in most jurisdictions, at least not at a level
where development decisions are seriously affected. Wildfire risk maps
comparable with floodplain maps are virtually non-existent outside of
California, and few jurisdictions take steps to limit or even require conditions
on development due to wildfire risk. n21

   The growth of residential development in areas at risk from wildfire is
starting to be reflected in the data on destroyed structures during wildfires.
Wildfire management statistics n22 indicate that even though the number of
wildfires has not increased much since 1984, the number of total acres and homes
destroyed has increased greatly.

[*185]

   Figure 1. Annual Trends in Wildfires and Acres Burned, 1984-2014 n23

  Figure 1. Annual Trends in Wildfires and Acres Burned, 1984-2014
 According to a 2015 report on estimated residential wildfire risk exposure for
the Western United States, more than 1.1 million homes with a total
reconstruction cost of $ 268 billion are considered at the highest rated risk.
n24 In Arizona, much of the southeastern and central parts of the state have
high to moderately high risk and most of the northern part of the state also has
moderate risk from wildfire.

   The state's hazard mitigation plan and risk assessment notes that wildfires
burn thousands of acres in Arizona annually. The report cites statistics for the
period of 1990-2011, when Arizona had an annual average of 3,068 wildfires
affecting an average of 213,302 acres each year. n25 On average, 57% of the
wildfires were human caused, while 43% were lightning caused. n26 "A combination
of extended drought, unhealthy forest conditions, and expanding population
centers support the likelihood of increased wildfire occurrence  [*186]  and
more severe impacts over the coming years." n27 Community leaders, forestry
officials, fire departments and residents will all be significantly impacted by
these conditions in the State of Arizona in the future.

   Figure 2. Arizona Fire Potential Map n28

  Figure 2. Arizona Fire Potential Map
 Recent Arizona wildfire losses across the spectrum of life, property and
environmental resources are well documented. n29 Most fresh in the public's mind
is the devastating loss of nineteen firefighters in the 2013 Yarnell Hill
[*187]  fire. n30 This lightning-caused fire that eventually burned 8,400 acres
by early July 2013 originated 3.5 miles west of the community of Yarnell. n31



   On Sunday, June 28th, the fire rapidly grew in size and intensity. Strong
erratic winds pushed the fire in several directions at the same time. Nineteen
members of the Granite Mountain Hotshot Crew lost their lives battling this fire
on June 30, 2013. Residents of the communities of Yarnell and Peeples Valley
were forced to evacuate. 108 homes in Yarnell were destroyed, with another 25
damaged. n32

 In the same year, two other major fires burned more than 12,000 acres total.
n33 During the same time as the Yarnell Hill fire, the Dean Peak Fire burned
approximately 5,400 acres. n34 It was a lightning-caused fire in the Hualapai
Mountains, ten miles southeast of Kingman, leading to evacuation of the
communities of Pine Lake and Pinion Pine Estates. n35 No structures were
destroyed. n36 A month earlier in June, the Doce fire began burning in the
Prescott National Forest, eight miles northwest of Prescott. n37 Believed to be
human-caused, the fire required 781 personnel to bring it under control. n38
Residents of Williamson Valley were forced to evacuate 465 homes. n39
Fortunately, no homes were destroyed in this fire, in spite of the burning of
6,732 acres. n40

   According to the InciWeb Incident Information System website operated by the
National Wildfire Coordinating Group, summer and early fall of 2015 continued to
see high wildfire activity. n41 In August and September 2015 alone, more than
41,000 acres were consumed by wildfire. n42

 Even though, over time, the number of wildfires on average each year has not
dramatically increased, the acreage burned shows a significant upward trend. n43
In many large fire events, greater intensity of burning has also been
documented. n44 Trends point to a growing risk from wildfire in Arizona and
throughout the United States at the same time as federal funding to help fight
the fires as well as assist with pre-fire mitigation efforts is decreasing.

   According to a recent paper by the Congressional Research Service, the
federal funding for wildfire management provided in the Interior, Environment,
and Related Agencies appropriations bill, which funds wildfire management at the
Forest Service and the Department of the Interior (the two principal entities
tasked with federal wildfire management) have decreased rather than increased
over the last two fiscal years. n45 The funding for federal wildfire response
activities involve preparedness, suppression, fuel reduction, site
rehabilitation, and more. n46 Some $ 3.4 billion was appropriated for wildfire
management in federal fiscal year 2015, n47 down from 2014 appropriations of
more than $ 3.9 billion. n48 This also included $ 600 million for the Forest
Service to reimburse wildfire transfers that occurred in fiscal  [*189]  year
2013. n49 The budget for fire prevention has fallen steadily, from $ 350 million
in 2010 to $ 301 million in 2013. n50

   II. Keeping the Focus on the Community

 Knowing the scope and magnitude of the wildland fire problem as it impacts
homes and communities, and acknowledging that the outlook for a federal
government solution to mounting losses is hazy, what then are effective
solutions, and at what scale? NFPA's Firewise program has sought, since 1997, to
bring fire science research on home ignition during wildfires directly to
residents, community officials, local fire departments, and state agencies
engaged in forest and fire management. n51 The research indicates that homes
burning down during wildfires is a solvable problem, if we keep the focus on the
home and community.

   III. How Do Homes Ignite?

 The research that demonstrates what causes a home to ignite during a wildfire
event is the basis for risk assessments that NFPA requires of communities as
they begin the process of becoming recognized in the Firewise program. Knowing
the factors that make a home vulnerable to ignition during a wildfire helps
individuals and communities take effective action to change those factors.

   There are many myths about how homes burn down during a wildfire. News media
and even firefighters may talk about the fire as a sentient being that "chooses"
homes to burn and "spares" others. n52 People assume that a "wave" of fire will
destroy everything in its path. n53 Many people believe that homes "explode"
from heating up from the large flames of a wildfire. n54 However, post-fire
research, models and experiments starting as early as  [*190]  1961 have
demonstrated the inaccurate assumptions about wildfire and home destruction. n55

   Post-fire investigation findings from the Bel Air-Brentwood WUI fire in Los
Angeles in 1961 were groundbreaking in that the investigators examined the homes
that survived within the fire perimeter. n56 They found that 95% of homes that
had nonflammable roofs and between thirty to sixty feet of modified vegetation
around the home survived this devastating fire. n57 This finding was reinforced
in a similar investigation in 1990 of the Paint Fire in Santa Barbara, n58 where
86% of homes with nonflammable roofs and modified landscaping survived within
the fire perimeter. n59 These findings indicated that if the home itself was
ignition-resistant - especially the roof - and the immediate surroundings were
clear of most fuel for the fire, homes were unlikely to ignite.

   The emphasis on "how homes ignite," vs. "how homes burn," is an important
distinction in discussing WUI fire disasters. During a major wildfire event,
with dozens or hundreds of homes exposed to wildfire's flames and embers, there
are almost never enough fire suppression resources - people, vehicles, water -
to conduct structure fire protection on every home. Often, no firefighters are
present in neighborhoods where embers and flames encroach because they are
fighting the fire in another location. Thus, it matters very much that homes do
not ignite - because there is usually no way to extinguish the small ignition in
the midst of a major event. It matters less "how homes burn," since once they
have ignited, they inevitably will burn unless there is intervention with fire
suppression resources.

   Pre-eminent fire science researcher, Dr. Jack D. Cohen with the United States
Department of Agriculture Forest Service Fire Research Lab in Missoula, Montana,
coined the term "home ignition zone" to describe the area of focus for treatment
and modification to minimize ignition during  [*191]  wildfires. n60 His
research strongly supports the notion of keeping the focus of fire mitigation
efforts on the home and community in order to solve the problem of homes burning
down during wildfires. n61 According to Dr. Cohen:



   Wildland-urban fire occurs when a fire burning in wildland vegetation fuels
gets close enough with its flames and/or firebrands (lofted burning embers) to
potentially create ignitions of the residential fuels. Residential fire
destruction is the principal problem during wildland-urban fires, but homes that
do not ignite do not burn. Recognizing the potential for wildland-urban home
ignitions and preventing home ignitions is the principal challenge. n62

 Cohen's research results showed that the condition of the home and its
immediate surroundings located with 100 to 200 feet are the main cause for home
ignitions. n63 Research has determined that fire is an important part of the
ecosystems across the United States. n64 This understanding about the fire
adapted ecosystems that residents live in along with an understanding about
where the ignition points of the home are will help homeowners and communities
determine what they need to do to reduce their risk to loss. n65 This
understanding will enable them to build and maintain communities that are
compatible with wildfire in Fire Adapted Communities rather than working on
preventing fire from encroaching into the community.

   Cohen's groundbreaking research included home ignition experiments during the
International Crown Fire Experiment series in 1998. n66 He demonstrated that
radiant heat from the large flames of a stand of burning trees failed to ignite
wood walls as close as ten meters (thirty-three feet) from the flame exposure.
n67 By shifting the focus from the large crown fire (wildland fire in forests
that reach the crowns of the trees) to the home ignition zone, his research
helped NFPA and other safety advocates effectively reach residents with the
message that home survival in a wildfire was a possibility and a matter that was
largely within their control as property owners. n68

[*192]

   Figure 3 [see org] Further research by Cohen and his colleagues pointed to
the need for property owners to work collectively to reduce ignition risks in
neighborhoods because of the impact of embers and the potential for
structure-to-structure ignition once the community is exposed to a wildfire's
flames and embers. n69

   The holistic view reinforces the notion that the hazard and the solution are
"owned" by the property owner, and that traditional thinking about fire
suppression is not helpful in the wildland fire exposure scenario. Cohen wrote:



   If the extreme wildfire spreads close enough to residential development with
its flames and firebrands (lofted burning embers), hundreds of ignitable homes
can be simultaneously exposed. Although protection may be effective for some
homes, an extreme wildfire's high intensities and high rate of area growth
(rapid spread  [*193]  and spot ignitions) ignites too many houses and threatens
firefighters' safety, preventing them from protecting all structures. n70

 It is important for homeowners to take actions to protect their own homes
because there will not be enough fire trucks available to protect every home
during a wildfire disaster. With the impact of embers, it is the little things
that can make a difference to home survivability. Cohen's research strongly
indicates the potential for an extreme wildfire event to occur without
triggering a WUI disaster with large-scale home loss. n71 Thus, disasters in the
WUI mainly depend on the ignition potential of homes and that ignition potential
can be reduced with effective modifications made by homeowners.

   Figure 4

  Figure 4
 More recent research reinforces and adds nuance to the argument for attention
to the home ignition zone. The Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety
(IBHS) has engaged in experiments on how embers ignite  [*194]  homes. n72 As
part of its research effort to study and understand the vulnerabilities of
buildings subjected to wildfire exposures, IBHS developed the capability of
simulating ember and radiant heat exposures on building components and
assemblies at its Research Center in Richburg, South Carolina. The primary
objective of this research is to reduce the likelihood of wildfire-caused
building ignitions in communities located in wildfire-prone areas.

   Dr. Stephen Quarles, senior research scientist at IBHS and an expert on
building durability, wildfire and moisture exposures, looks at ember exposure to
homes during a wildfire event by recreating those conditions in the lab. n73 A
growing body of research and evidence from post-fire investigations in the last
research emphasize the importance of the threat of ember exposure, and strongly
indicate that the majority of structure ignitions during wildfires have been
caused by embers. n74 Embers can ignite combustible building components and
contents directly, or ignite vegetation and other combustible items located
adjacent to or near a building. n75 Once ignited, this material can expose a
home or business to radiant heat and direct contact with flames.

   These findings have prompted practical advice for property owners to modify
the home ignition zone. n76 According to Dr. Quarles, "By creating a
noncombustible zone in the 5 feet immediately next to your home or business you
will remove most things that could be ignited by wind-blown embers during a
wildfire. Consider using rock or stone mulch instead of bark, pine needles or
other combustible mulch products." n77

[*195]

   Figure 5

  Figure 5
 A series of ember experiments clearly showed the potential for embers to ignite
vegetative debris that can either accumulate on the roof, in a gutter, or at the
base of a wall, and combustible mulch products that can be placed adjacent to
the home or business. n78 Ignition of these combustible materials will result in
a flame contact exposure to adjacent materials, including siding, windows,
materials at the edge of the roof, and even nearby vegetation. n79

   The repeated conclusion of models, experiments, and post fire investigations
is that if homes do not ignite, they will not burn. n80 Homeowners can do a lot
to reduce their risk from wildfire by making changes to the home itself and the
area immediately surrounding the home to prevent ignition. n81

[*196]

   IV. Why Firewise? The Need for Collective Voluntary Action

 As discussed, the WUI is not a place but a set of conditions present during a
wildfire that create elevated risk to damage and destruction. n82 These
conditions can be lessened or mitigated with collective voluntary action based
on sound science - Firewise principles - to lessen the potential for homes to
ignite. n83 These conditions are oftentimes shared neighbor to neighbor due to
the close proximity of homes to one another which creates overlapping or shared
ignition zones. n84 It is therefore not just the responsibility of individual
homeowners to implement Firewise principles but the community at large. This is
the foundation of a Firewise Community: neighbors helping neighbors reduce risk
collectively in a voluntary grass roots program.

   The Firewise process has been proven to be effective at lessening wildfire
risk. n85 The work of Firewise Communities and their success has been recognized
nationally by the insurance industry, with one major company to date (USAA)
providing discounts to their policyholders that reside in Firewise Communities
in selected states. n86

   The Firewise process is simple and relies on the community to engage and take
action. In order to achieve recognition, the community must undertake a
community-wide wildfire risk assessment, usually performed by a state forestry
staffer or fire department specialist. n87 With an understanding of the specific
fire risks in the community, volunteers come together to form a board or
committee to manage the process. n88 They create a simple plan of action that
responds to the findings in the risk assessment. They then conduct a public
event, known as a Firewise Day, to engage neighbors in activities such as
trimming brush, clearing debris, or chipping up material that people have
cleared on their properties. n89 They document their volunteer time, any in-kind
services, and any grants they may have used within the community on this effort.
n90 They must demonstrate that at least $ 2 per capita has been devoted  [*197]
to Firewise work during the year. n91 This requirement means that residents have
a stake in the process and it also indicates that this process is easier to
employ in a small community such as a neighborhood or subdivision. Finally, the
committee fills out a simple form, has it verified by the state forestry agency,
and sends it to NFPA. n92 In return, NFPA provides recognition materials
including signage, a plaque and publicity. n93 Each year, communities document
their Firewise Day activity and their annual investment in order to renew their
status. More than 1,200 communities currently participate in this program across
40 states. n94 In Arizona, there are notable examples of Firewise successes. One
such example is the Prescott area community of Forest Highlands. n95

   Forest Highlands is a 1,100-acre private residential community nestled at
7,000 feet among majestic pines and groves of mature oaks and aspens; it is five
miles south of Flagstaff, Arizona in Coconino County. n96 The development
consists of 825 home sites, with 655 homes constructed to date. n97 The majority
of the homes are second residences for the homeowner association's 877 members.
n98 Forest Highlands has its own 24-hour security staff, public works
department, water and wastewater companies, two golf courses and all the normal
amenities of a fully self-contained residential and recreational Community. n99
The Highlands Fire District provides fire protection, with the fire department
1/4 mile from the community boundary. n100

   Forest Highlands is a young community whose development started in January
1987 with the sale of the first home site. n101 The first home was completed in
early 1988. n102 The vision for Forest Highlands was a pristine mountain
wilderness community in perfect harmony with its dramatic natural environment.
n103 Ownership and management responsibilities transferred from  [*198]  the
developer to a homeowners association (HOA) in January 1996. n104 The HOA
manages, controls and protects its community resources through a board and
standing committees comprised of HOA members. n105 The top priority for the HOA
is - and has been - the protection of its members, their homes and of course
home values. Because of its location within the largest stand of Ponderosa pines
in the world, the number one threat to Forest Highlands is forest fire. n106
Accordingly, the HOA has focused its protection and risk management initiatives
on fire risk, protection, and safety. n107 The Board of Directors and the
Firewise, Security, Public Works and Design Review Committees have led this
effort. n108

   From information residents shared with the NFPA in order to renew their
Firewise Community Recognition status for 2014,



   Approximately 988 residents observed or participated in our Firewise Day
activities. The Forest Highlands Fire Department in conjunction with the Forest
Highlands Recreation Department and Safety and Compliance Department set up a
day of public events with the "Firewise" theme in mind. During the Forest
Highlands community-wide BBQ on July 4, 2014 the fire truck was brought out and
an Educational Firewise booth was set up to inform the members of the
communities about being Firewise. The booth was equipped with Firewise materials
and a display, showing varies elements of how the community is and remains a
Firewise community. Additionally, we held our first "Chipper Days" on Aug 3-5
and over 63 residents participated by thinning their properties in advance of
the event and had their branches and limbs at the street for the community
chipper. Note: the above "Current Year Investment for 2014 also includes $
378,000 invested by residents who replaced their roofs with fire safe materials
on 21 homes." n109

 The successive years of work on the landscape and homes in Forest Highlands,
and the lasting dedication of their volunteer efforts, is a Firewise success
story. From the beginning of 2000 to the end of 2014, Forest Highlands has
invested $ 1,940,083 into fire prevention and mitigation efforts in their
community, much of which is sweat equity. n110 The success of their  [*199]
willingness to invest this kind of money and time into these efforts is
something that can and should be emulated by other communities in the WUI.

   V. If Voluntary Programs Work, Why Regulate?

 The story of Forest Highlands is but one narrative of successful Firewise
actions among hundreds across the nation. The value of applied Firewise
principles can be quantified with such measures as the Firewise investment
criteria described above, but becoming Firewise also reaps qualitative benefits
for communities. Testimony from places such as the Anthem Firewise community in
Phoenix, Arizona says it all.



   The impressive aspect to Anthem's Firewise community is that it was initiated
by Anthem residents, and they continue to spearhead efforts to keep our
community safe. Firewise Days, held in conjunction with Autumnfest, is
volunteer-driven by individuals and local partners who are committed and
dedicated to preserving our community. Through their efforts, we are able to
keep the message fresh, reach new audiences, broaden our e-news subscriber base,
and share valuable reminders about fire safety. n111

 If so much progress and goodwill can be generated from voluntary community
engagement in wildfire mitigation, then why should communities explore the
option of regulation? The evidence of application of enforceable measures such
as building codes, zoning ordinances and other wildfire safety rules that apply
to private property is scant across the United States. The relatively few
jurisdictions with formal regulations typically have passed them in reaction to
a significant fire event. While California's defensible space laws are an
exception, national experience shows that these, like similar rules in other
areas of the country, are difficult to enforce. n112 In spite of the status quo,
however, there is a strong case to be made for the need for sound building,
design and development standards that take the wildfire hazard into account.

   The need for Firewise is driven by the sheer magnitude of homes and
communities that already exist in harm's way. The significant population growth
and concomitant development over the last several decades means that there are
hundreds of thousands of structures in tens of thousands of communities that
need immediate attention for maintenance and retrofit in  [*200]  order to be
safer from wildfire. n113 This is not to imply, however, that new and future
development should be exempt from consideration when it comes to sensible
siting, design and construction. NFPA has produced guidelines including a primer
for developers titled Safer from the Start: A Guide to Firewise Friendly
Developments with the premise that a community designed and built with the fire
hazard in mind is a cost-effective way to gain a safety edge from the very
beginning of a new development or new home. n114

   Such guidance is not simply guesswork about what concepts and practical steps
will make homes and communities safer from wildfire. NFPA's primary business is
a consensus codes and standards process that uses volunteer expert committees
and public input to develop minimum safety standards across a range of fire,
electrical and related hazards. NFPA's technical committees are comprised of
individuals from diverse disciplines, including first responders, insurance
professionals, special experts, manufacturers, industry leaders, enforcers,
researchers, government officials, and independent contractors. n115 These
technical committees, under the guidance of NFPA staff, develop consensus
standards that can be adopted as enforceable codes or ordinances. n116 In the
field of wildland fire safety, NFPA standards have been developed to address
design and construction, among other issues. n117 The most pertinent standards
to this discussion include NFPA 1141, Standard for Fire Protection
Infrastructure for Land Development in Wildland, Rural, and Suburban Areas, n118
and NFPA 1144, Standard for Reducing Structure Ignition Hazards from Wildland
Fire. n119

   NFPA 1141

[*201]



   provides requirements for the development of fire protection and emergency
services infrastructure to make sure that wildland, rural, and suburban areas
undergoing land use changes or land development have the resources and
strategies in place to protect people and property from fire dangers, and allow
fire fighters to do their jobs safety and effectively. n120

 "Provisions in this document cover means of access including roadways, fire
lanes and parking lots; building access and separation; fire protection and fire
warning systems; water supply, fire protection during construction; capacity of
fire protection services; and community safety and emergency preparedness." n121

   NFPA 1144 "provides a methodology for assessing wildland fire ignition
hazards around existing structures and provides requirements for new
construction to reduce the potential of structure ignition from wildland fires."
n122 "Provisions specify how to perform a hazard assessment of each structure
ignition zone to determine relative risk, the extent of wildland fire hazard,
and appropriate mitigation measures." n123 "NFPA 1144 also presents design,
construction, and landscaping criteria for fires agencies, land use planners,
architects, developers, and local government for planning development in areas
that might be threatened by wildfire." n124

   These two standards are examples of tools that can be used and adopted by
legislators and government entities to create enforceable ordinances, community
codes and regulations. They can insure that residents are adhering to
science-based standards to make changes to their homes and the landscape
immediately surrounding their homes to reduce the risk of loss due to a wildfire
event. Regulation can encourage residents who are not participating voluntarily
to engage in Firewise efforts, thereby helping to make the community as a whole
safer. This is due in part to many homes in WUI communities and neighborhoods
being in close proximity to each other and having what is called an overlapping
home ignition zone. This means the condition of one home can affect the
survivability of the next door neighbor's home.

   Sound regulation that has been institutionalized into a state's or
community's way of doing business has the added benefit of addressing wildfire
safety in design and development and making it easier for future buyers of real
property to maintain that property in a relatively Firewise  [*202]  condition.
Standardized approaches to safer development also serve to level the playing
field for developers and builders and provide a measure of equity and fairness
with regard to requirements for new construction.

   The primary challenge to such regulation - aside from overcoming perceptions
that it is unnecessary or costly to builders and owners - is the ability and
capacity for enforcement on private property. n125 The Fire Protection Research
Foundation funded a study in 2011 on whether and how communities adopted
standards on wildland fire safety for new and existing development. Even among
the communities that could serve as models for the regulatory approach, the
chief obstacle to be overcome is the ability to enforce on the laws that are on
the books. n126

   Regulatory approaches can also relieve the tremendous burden on the private
property owner who may not realize when building or purchasing a home in the WUI
all that is implied by their responsibility for fire safety. While Jack Cohen
and others rightly rail against the longstanding culture of fire suppression
that have created the widespread misconception that WUI protection is solely a
fire service concern, n127 it is not entirely fair that all of the
responsibility for fire safety in WUI areas rest on the shoulders of homeowners.
If state and local governments undertake reasonable measures to address known
risk through safety standards for new development, the homeowner has some
measure of built-in safety to rely on and a more affordable and sustainable
basis from which to begin in the maintenance and enhancement of Firewise
practices.

   Conclusion

 We have learned what works to prevent home ignitions and thus eliminate the WUI
disaster problem. It is with a combination of voluntary behavior change,
incentives and sound planning and regulation, that communities can embrace and
will change the outcomes during future large wildfires. NFPA's mission seeks to
eliminate loss due to fire, electrical and related hazards. Firewise
Communities, a program of the NFPA, provides science based guidance that creates
opportunity for residents in communities to engage in  [*203]  grass roots
efforts to lessen their risk to a wildfire event. Over the course of time,
efforts of Firewise Communities to improve the condition of their homes and the
landscape immediately surrounding their homes have proven effective in reducing
losses of property and lives.

   Standards developed by the NFPA can also provide a template for a safer
future. When such standards are adopted to create enforceable ordinances and
regulations, there is a clearly-defined method for governments and residents to
make effective changes based upon scientific principles. With these elements in
place, it becomes possible for communities at risk for WUI disaster to adapt to
the reality of nature's fire sustainably.

Washington: Western Senators, Secretary of Agriculture Agree: Wildfire Funding
Must be Fixed Now

LENGTH: 757  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Ron Wyden has issued the following news
release:

A bipartisan group of western senators pushing for their legislation to fix
"fire borrowing" heard strong evidence from Secretary of Agriculture Sonny
Perdue and fire experts at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S.
Forest Service that Congress should pass their bill to end fire borrowing.


The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, introduced by Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Mike
Crapo, R-Idaho, Jim Risch, R-Idaho, and Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and five other
bipartisan senators, would treat wildfires as natural disasters and stop the
erosion of the Forest Service's budget by reforming the way the federal
government funds wildfires. The legislation would end "fire borrowing," which
has depleted funds intended for forest restoration, habitat programs, trail
maintenance and fire prevention programs, such as thinning. More than 250
private and public organizations have supported the legislation.
Wyden, Crapo, Risch and Bennet attended a Washington, D.C. briefing today where
the Forest Service announced all-time record spending of more than $2 billion to
pay to fight this year's wildfires, which have destroyed significant parts of
the West. Once again, the senators noted, federal agencies have had to empty
non-fire accounts of more than a half-billion dollars to pay for wildfires. More
than 8.5 million acres have burned across the country this year - a 47 percent
increase from the 10-year average of 5.8 million acres. The emergency
preparedness levels for fire are at the highest point in five years.
"My colleagues and I heard the message loud and clear today from Sec. Perdue:
the federal government cannot keep conducting 'business as usual' when it comes
to fire funding," Wyden said. "This year's devastating fires underscore the
urgency of this issue. Fixing this broken fire budgeting system is a bipartisan
idea and has been from the start. We're calling on Congress to pass our
bipartisan bill to end fire borrowing, stop the Forest Service from becoming the
'Fire Service' and start treating wildfires like the natural disasters they
are."
"We already know in the West about the devastation of these wildfires on our
habitat, our lungs, and on our heritage," Crapo said.  "Hopefully, now our
colleagues in the Senate will see the magnitude and immediacy of this problem
and end this 'fire borrowing' so that we can focus on fire prevention and focus
on saving lives, habitat and our favorite public lands places for the future."

"Wildfires are a catastrophic event just like an earthquake, hurricane, or
tornado. But there is one very big difference - wildfires are at least partially
preventable and almost fully manageable," Risch said. "If we set aside funds for
wildfire prevention ahead of time, we can actually tamper down the destruction.
This is what our legislation seeks to accomplish."
"Today's briefing on the historical cost of this year's wildfire season
emphasized the importance of changing the way we pay for fighting catastrophic
fires," Bennet said. "It was good to hear from Secretary Perdue about the
immediate need to end the penny wise, pound foolish practice of fire borrowing,
ensuring the Forest Service can do its job to mitigate future fires. The
opportunity to sit down with my colleagues and the Secretary to discuss the
Wildfire Disaster Funding Act of 2017 is a testament to the bipartisan interest
in passing this critical legislation."
The bipartisan Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would fund wildfires as natural
disasters and protect the agencies' fire prevention budgets by putting a freeze
on the rising budget costs of the 10-year average. It would end "fire borrowing"
by allowing the agencies to fund any fire suppression spending needed above the
frozen average through disaster funding just like other agencies can access
disaster funding for tornadoes, hurricanes and floods. It would also make room
for wildfires in the disaster budget so other natural disasters would not have
to "compete" for disaster funds.
Making disaster funding available after the appropriated fire suppression
funding is spent would allow the Forest Service to use its fire prevention
funding for its intended purpose - completing hazardous fuels reduction projects
that have been shown to help break the cycle of increasingly dangerous and
costly fires.
Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Cory Gardner, R-Colo., also cosponsored the bill.

Over the last 40 years, there is a surprising trend with California wildfires

BYLINE: Daniel Tedford

LENGTH: 1150 words



HIGHLIGHT: California wildfire data shows a trend that many may find hard to
believe.


In a year that is already being called one of the worst ever for wildfires in
the western United States, there is another fact that some may find remarkable:
For nearly 40 years, the number of wildfires in California has been declining.

California wildfire data reviewed by a USGS research ecologist shows a trend
that many may find hard to believe: Since a peak in 1980, there have been fewer
and fewer wildfires in California. This is true across the entire state,
according to researcher Jon Keeley, who is also a professor at UCLA.

According to his paper, co-authored with Alexandra D. Syphard, we need to
rethink our ideas about the frequency of wildfires.

The claim commonly made in research papers and the media that fire activity is
increasing throughout the western USA is certainly an over-statement, wrote the
authors.

The trend of fewer, but not smaller fires is apparent in recent years. State
data regarding large wildfires (300 acres or more) from 2000 to 2015 show total
numbers  not fire size  has been in decline, despite a sharp spike in 2008.

So, whats the reason for this decline? Well, they dont know yet.

Cant say at this point what has changed in the last 100 years that has caused
this decline but I am hoping we might find out, Keeley said.

What might be behind a decline in wildfires?

Keeley has just begun to analyze the data and look for a reason, but he expects
to finish that analysis by the end of September. He is also sending his research
to Calfire for review.

Keeley is confident the culprits behind the decline can be narrowed down to two
options  prevention or climate  but he is reserving his judgment for now.

Maybe fire prevention strategies or could be related to climate, Keeley said. My
guess is they would probably like to think it is increasing efficiency in fire
prevention but remains to be seen if that is the answer at this point.

Skeggs Fire near Woodside now 60 percent contained

Crews make good progress in containing Skeggs Fire

Crews contain 15 fires started by lightning in Monterey County

San Mateo County forest fire sparked by lightning now 10 percent contained
Keeley is hoping Calfire might be able to point to some specific prevention
strategies and dates they were implemented to help him suss out if they had a
major impact in wildfire declines.

We definitely have the education side, Calfire spokesman Scott McLean said. We
spend a lot of money being proactive in trying to educate the public.

While McLean said the organization has adopted social media and other modern
tactics in recent years to better reach the public about fire prevention,
Calfires educations efforts have been happening for decades.

There are some embarrassing programs out there with blue leisure suits and
mullets, he said.

McLean said a decline in the amount of wildfires was a win for the agencys
outreach programs since the majority of wildfires are the result of human
causes.

I love to see the trend of wildfires going down, McLean said. That means we are
getting the message out.

While the amount of wildfires has gone down, something else has been happening

Despite the decline in overall fires, the amount of acres burned by wildfires
isnt following the same trend. In fact, acreage burned by wildfires is doing
just the opposite.

For most ignition sources we have found a decline in the numbers since the
1980s, but not a decline in the area burned, Keeley said.

Large wildfire numbers from 2000 to 2015 illustrate the growth in burned
acreage. While the numbers are volatile year to year, the overall trend shows
growth in fire sizes.

McLean attributes the growth in acres burned to environmental factors that have
made fires burn hotter and faster than in the past. Despite that, he credited
Calfire for its work in keeping the majority of fires from spreading. According
to Calfire data, 95 percent of fires are kept under 10 acres.

and beyond.

We are constantly training. We always pay attention to what is going on, we
always investigate, he said. We investigate what took place and we learn from it
and we make sure our firefighters learn from it.

One reason acreage may be up is from the record winter rains that replenished
fuel for fires by spawning plant growth, including the return of grass that had
disappeared from wildland areas throughout Southern California during the
drought.

Grass fires tend to burn faster and increase the amount of acres burned,
according to a 2008 paper published by UC Merced Sierra Nevada Research
Institutes Anthony Westerling.

Moreover, the presence of fine fuels within a region may also give rise to
higher monthly mean acres burned, because fine fuelsgrasses especiallyregenerate
faster than heavy fuels, shortening the interval between burns. Finally, the
tendency for area burned to be greater in areas characterized by fine fuel types
is strongest early in the fire season (June), and may simply reflect the earlier
arrival of warm, dry summer conditions at lower elevations.

Other researchers point to climate change, but Keeley says he thinks there may
be other variables at-play.

People who have written on it tend to ascribe it to climate change, but I think
we are a long way from knowing if that is what is going on, he said.

2017 trending in the wrong direction

During the last 40 years, there have been a number of years that have bucked the
trend of dwindling wildfire numbers and 2017 is already well on its way to being
one of those outliers.

As of Sept. 11, Calfire has reported 5,102 wildland fires in their jurisdiction
with nearly 230,000 acres burned. During the same time period in 2016, there
were 3,803 wildfires and 204,000 acres burned. The five-year average has been
3,872 wildland fires and 155,807 acres burned, according to Calfire.

2017 is also the most expensive year for wildfires as Montana, Washington and
Oregon, among others, have all been hit by devastating blazes. As a result, U.S.
Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Purdue announced Thursday the cost of fighting
fires has exceeded $2 billion. It has also been a record-setting year for heat
in California and other western states, according to the National Climate Report
produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

While 2017 has been worse than predicted across western states after there were
hopes a wet winter would diminish the fire season, McLean wasnt surprised by the
numbers considering the years of drought and the fuel created by the rain that
preceded fire season.

As a firefighter, you wake up in the morning whats the weather doing because
that tells you what your day is going to be like, he said.

System to keep drones from fires kicks off

BYLINE: By , @bayareanewsgroup.com

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 471 words


BOISE, Idaho -- The first national system intended to prevent hobby drones from
interfering with planes and helicopters fighting wildfires has launched, federal
authorities say.

The U.S. Interior Department announced the kickoff of the pilot project Monday
that uses a smartphone app and real-time wildfire information to create virtual
boundaries, or geofences, that drones can't cross.

Officials say drones colliding with firefighting aircraft could be catastrophic.
Planes and helicopters have been grounded numerous times this year because of
drones, most recently on Sunday in Southern California where 10,000 homes are
threatened by fire. Earlier this month authorities arrested a man they say flew
a drone over a Northern California wildfire and grounded firefighting aircraft.

"We believe this program, which uses the global positioning system to create a
virtual barrier, will move us one step closer to eliminating this problem for
wildfire managers," Mark Bathrick, director of the Interior Department's Office
of Aviation Services, said in a statement.

The Interior Department developed the system with DJI, the world's largest
civilian drone-maker, and two other companies that specialize in offering
navigational information to drone fliers, AirMap and Skyward.

Specifically, the Interior Department allows AirMap and Skyward to get the
latest wildfire information directly from the federal agency's Integrated
Reporting Wildland-Fire Information program.

That information is then pushed to drone pilots through apps on their
smartphones, with the smartphones typically used to navigate in combination with
the drone's GPS.

DJI has its own app called DJI GO. AirMap pushes the Interior Department's
wildfire flight restriction information to DJI. DJI uses it as a safety feature
that prevents its drones from flying in temporary flight restrictions at
wildfires. It even prevents DJI drones from taking off in wildfire restricted
areas. The system can be overridden by those authorized to fly over a wildfire.

"This enhancement ... will help prevent DJI drones from inadvertently taking off
within, or flying into, a wildfire location without authorization," Brendan
Schulman, DJI Vice President of Policy and Legal Affairs, said in a statement.

Ben Marcus, CEO of AirMap, said DJI is the only drone maker so far to take that
step but attributed it more to DJI's large size. He expected smaller companies
that make drones to begin integrating the technology as well to set up the
geofences around wildfires based on Interior Department information.

For drone pilots without a DJI drone, smartphone apps can still provide the
Interior Department's location of wildfire flight restrictions, but it will be
up to the operators to avoid flying over a wildfire rather than the drone
technology automatically preventing an incursion.

ENVIRONMENT;
A wake-up call for Canada from Western wildfires

BYLINE: TODDI STEELMAN

SECTION: COMMENT; Pg. A12

LENGTH: 576 words


Executive director and professor, School of Environment and Sustainability,
University of Saskatchewan

Hey Canada! Mother Nature is calling. She wants you to know that climate change
is real, and she is going to kick your butt with another bad fire season unless
you wake up and smell the smoke.

Nearly four million hectares have burned so far this year in Canada - close to
double the average season. Record numbers of people were forced to move in
Saskatchewan. British Columbia experienced its warmest winter and spring to date
since 1948, when temperatures were first regularly recorded, and has battled
1,400 wildfires this season so far; 10 per cent are still burning.

Alberta called on firefighters from Mexico, New Zealand, Australia and the
United States for help.

August is typically a very active fire month, so we aren't out of the frying pan
yet.

The wildfires across Western Canada are entirely consistent with what
climate-change models have predicted for boreal forests.

Wildfires will burn more intensely over more hectares. Wildfire season is
predicted to last longer.

And Canada isn't alone: This is a global phenomenon. Mega-fires, those that
result in significant economic and social damage, are also increasing in Russia,
the United States, Asia and Australia.

This is a wake-up call for us to learn to co-exist with wildfire.

Wildfire is one of the only natural hazards that we believe we can control. We
would never try to stop a tornado, hurricane or earthquake. So why do we think
we can control wildfire, especially as it increases in intensity? Wildfire
professionals are confirming that they are encountering wildfire behaviour never
before witnessed. In ignoring these realities, we put more people at risk, spend
more money and do a disservice to the ecological systems that need wildfire to
be healthy.

Canada needs a more sustainable wildfire-management strategy - one that would
not only consider what is needed in the next fire season, but also anticipate
what is needed in the next 20 fire seasons.

What would this look like? At the community level, it would firmly embrace the
need to mitigate, prepare, respond and recover. Communities need to adapt to
living with fire. That means not just spending more to respond to fire, but
spending more to mitigate the risks before they occur.

This includes reducing the risk of building near places where forests and
communities meet, establishing fuel breaks around communities, working with
local emergency responders ahead of fire season to anticipate evacuation needs
and creating fireadapted landscapes around homes. Using fire-resistant materials
in home construction and making informed decisions about why and how to live in
a hazardous area also would be part of an effective pro-active plan.

At the provincial and federal level, it would mean taking a hard look at our
assumptions that underlie how we are currently preparing for, and responding to,
wildfire. Officials need to rethink what kind of strategic and program
investments to make in the face of changing fire environments due to climate
change.

How much active fire management do we want to undertake under what conditions?
What kinds of risks do we want to take, including those that affect our
firefighters? What kind of work force is necessary to carry out a capable
response, while also learning to live more adaptively with wildfire?

The phone is ringing and Mother Nature is on the line. Don't let it go to voice
mail.

The West Virginia Wildfire is looking for a few good women - who can be
downright defensive (or offensive) at the snap of a football.

The Wildfire is a women's tackle football team which belongs to the Women's
Spring Football League. The team's inaugural season, as the Wildfire, got
underway last April, with home games played at the Riverside High School
football field in Belle.

According to its website, the West Virginia Wildfire's mission is: "to give
women athletes in West Virginia an opportunity to play full-contact football as
an organized sport while creating a unique entertainment experience for our
community and our fans. To further the sport of women's football by creating
awareness in our area and giving young girls with the hope of one day playing
the sport the opportunity. To be involved in community service events promoting
fitness initiatives and the advancement of women and girls."

Bob Koontz of Charleston is the head coach of the West Virginia Wildfire, which
he co-owns with his wife, Kimberly, who also plays both the offensive and
defensive line for the team.

The tentative spring roster thus far includes Jennifer Arbogast of Charleston,
Tiffany Boggess of Charleston, Keri Bragg of Turtle Creek, Bobbie Braley of
Fraziers Bottom, Jessica Burnette of Marmet, Liz Honegger of Montgomery,
Adrienne Kees of Oak Hill, Kimberly Koontz of Charleston, Fanica Payne of
Dunbar, Mercedes Robinson of Marmet, Leslie Scott of Charleston, Nakia Summers
of Teays Valley, Kisha Walker of Charleston and Samantha Williams. Aside from
Koontz and Walker, who have three years of experience each, all of the players
will be entering their second season with the Wildfire.

Last year's season began with rocky results; in April, the Wildfire were blanked
twice by the Cape Fear Thunder. On April 20, the Wildfire lost 40-0 to Cape
Fear. A week later, they fell 47-0 to the Thunder.

In May, the Wildfire fell to the West Virginia Bruisers 13-6. In June, they tied
the Cape Fear Thunder 6-6 in their first meeting and lost 13-6 in the second
matchup. The West Virginia Bruisers defeated the Wildfire 16-6 on June 18.

All-Star players for the 2011 season were Adrienne Kees, Jessica Burnette,
Jennifer Arbogast, Fanica Payne, Nakia Summers and Samantha Williams.

Spanning the United States, the Women's Spring Football League started play two
years ago. The league is divided into 11-player and eight-player divisions.

The 11-player teams include: the Arkansas Rampage, the Atlanta Heartbreakers,
the Baltimore Burn, the Binghamton Tiger Cats, the D.C. Saints, the Finger Lakes
Falcons, the Frederick Saints, the Huntsville Tigers, the Iowa Thunder, the
Louisville Belles, the Mass. Chaos, the New Jersey Titans, the North Texas
Knockouts, the Savannah Vizionz and the Tri-State Bruisers.

As well as the West Virginia Wildfire, the eight-player division is made up of
the Cape Fear Thunder, the Carolina Freedom, the Desert Fire Cats, the Kansas
City Phoenix, the Las Vegas Heat, the Nevada Storm, the Racine Pirates, the Salt
City Arch Angels and the Ventura Black Widows.

Women 18 years old or older (or 16 and 17, with parents' permission) are
encouraged to try out for the Wildfire. For more information, including
donations or sponsorship opportunities, direct e-mail messages to
wildfirefootball@gmail.com or call/text 304-542-8831.

The 2011 West Virginia Wildfire players and coaches are seen in this photograph
from the women's tackle football team's website. Owners Bob and Kimberly Koontz
are recruiting players for the upcoming spring season.

Editorial: Ratepayers should not have to pay for utilities wildfires negligence

BYLINE: Mercury News & East Bay Times Editorial Boards

LENGTH: 532 words



HIGHLIGHT: Four California lawmakers will introduce a bill in January that would
stop the practice of allowing utilities to push the burden of their negligence
on ratepayers


        Wildfires: Utility blocked from charging customers for wildfire costs

PG&E says it faces adverse financial effects from wildfires fallout

Editorial: California ratepayers should not pay PG&Es Wine Country wildfires
bill

Full recovery from California wildfires may take years

PG&E says someone elses wires may have started deadly blaze

Here is what the PUC is doing about wildfires and PG&E      If California
utilities had a stronger sense of public responsibility, state lawmakers wouldnt
need to write legislation prohibiting them from passing fines, penalties and
other costs on to ratepayers when power lines cause wildfires. But its clear
consumers do need this protection.

Last week in San Diego, the California Public Utilities Commission denied a
request from San Diego Gas and Electric to charge ratepayers $379 million for
damage caused in 2007 by three major wildfires in the San Diego area. The
decision was encouraging, but the Legislature cant count on it carrying the day.
San Diego Gas and Electric has said it will vigorously pursue all available
avenues to reverse the ruling.

Those fires killed two people and burned more than 1,000 homes. Investigators
determined that the San Diego utility had not maintained its system in a
reasonable and prudent manner when the fires began.

PG&E has already said it wants to charge ratepayers, not shareholders, if its
equipment is found to have caused the Wine Country fires that killed 42 people,
destroyed 8,700 homes and buildings, and burned 245,000 acres. The cause of
those fires has yet to be determined.

PG&E has said it only has $800 million in liability insurance available to cover
costs that have been estimated as high as $3 billion.

Four California lawmakers plan to introduce a bill in January to ensure that
utilities cannot push the burden of their negligence onto customers. Sen. Jerry
Hill, who chairs the Senate subcommittee on Gas, Electricity and Transportation
Safety, is adamant that PG&E shareholders should absorb the costs if the utility
is found to have acted in an irresponsible manner.

If PG&E wont accept responsibility for its actions, then the Legislature must
step in, Hill said on Monday.

The San Mateo Democrat will join Sens. Mike McGuire of Healdsburg and Scott
Wiener of San Francisco and Assemblyman Marc Levine of San Rafael in sponsoring
the bill.

Its entirely possible that something other than downed power lines started the
Wine Country fires in October. Even if downed lines were the cause, its possible
that PG&E had met all of the state standards for maintaining its lines.
Unusually high winds may have been to blame. Ratepayers should share the
responsibility under those circumstances.

Californians should never accept the burden of paying for a utilitys negligence,
however. Its shameful that the companies try to shift that burden when their own
failings contribute to a disaster. In the case of PG&E, its staking out its
claim even before a cause or causes of the fire are established.

Keep that in mind next time the utility runs one of its big public-relations
campaigns to try to restore customers trust.

New wildfire near Tatla Lake

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 203 words


The BC Wildfire Service is responding to a new wildfire approximately 20
kilometres west of Tatla Lake and about 200 kilometres west of Williams Lake.

The fire was discovered on June 25 and is estimated to be 6 hectares in size. It
is classified as being 'Out of Control' as of 3:30 p.m. on June 25.

This wildfire does not pose an immediate threat to public safety or homes at
this time. Smoke from the fire is visible from Highway 20. There are no impacts
to the highway at this time.

There are currently airtankers, two helicopters and 10 firefighters on site.
Heavy equipment is en route.

The cause of this fire is under investigation. Smoke will be visible this
afternoon from nearby areas.

The BC Wildfire Service strongly urges members of the public to stay well away
from the area where this wildfire is burning, since their presence could put the
safety of firefighting crews and others at risk. Public access to a wildfire
site is not allowed during fire suppression operations, under the provisions of
the Wildfire Act and WorkSafeBC regulations.

The West Virginia Wildfire is looking for a few good women - who can be
downright defensive (or offensive) at the snap of a football.

The Wildfire is a women's tackle football team which belongs to the Women's
Spring Football League. The team's inaugural season, as the Wildfire, got
underway last April, with home games played at the Riverside High School
football field in Belle.

According to its website, the West Virginia Wildfire's mission is: "to give
women athletes in West Virginia an opportunity to play full-contact football as
an organized sport while creating a unique entertainment experience for our
community and our fans. To further the sport of women's football by creating
awareness in our area and giving young girls with the hope of one day playing
the sport the opportunity. To be involved in community service events promoting
fitness initiatives and the advancement of women and girls."

Bob Koontz of Charleston is the head coach of the West Virginia Wildfire, which
he co-owns with his wife, Kimberly, who also plays both the offensive and
defensive line for the team.

The tentative spring roster thus far includes Jennifer Arbogast of Charleston,
Tiffany Boggess of Charleston, Keri Bragg of Turtle Creek, Bobbie Braley of
Fraziers Bottom, Jessica Burnette of Marmet, Liz Honegger of Montgomery,
Adrienne Kees of Oak Hill, Kimberly Koontz of Charleston, Fanica Payne of
Dunbar, Mercedes Robinson of Marmet, Leslie Scott of Charleston, Nakia Summers
of Teays Valley, Kisha Walker of Charleston and Samantha Williams. Aside from
Koontz and Walker, who have three years of experience each, all of the players
will be entering their second season with the Wildfire.

Last year's season began with rocky results; in April, the Wildfire were blanked
twice by the Cape Fear Thunder. On April 20, the Wildfire lost 40-0 to Cape
Fear. A week later, they fell 47-0 to the Thunder.

In May, the Wildfire fell to the West Virginia Bruisers 13-6. In June, they tied
the Cape Fear Thunder 6-6 in their first meeting and lost 13-6 in the second
matchup. The West Virginia Bruisers defeated the Wildfire 16-6 on June 18.

All-Star players for the 2011 season were Adrienne Kees, Jessica Burnette,
Jennifer Arbogast, Fanica Payne, Nakia Summers and Samantha Williams.

Spanning the United States, the Women's Spring Football League started play two
years ago. The league is divided into 11-player and eight-player divisions.

The 11-player teams include: the Arkansas Rampage, the Atlanta Heartbreakers,
the Baltimore Burn, the Binghamton Tiger Cats, the D.C. Saints, the Finger Lakes
Falcons, the Frederick Saints, the Huntsville Tigers, the Iowa Thunder, the
Louisville Belles, the Mass. Chaos, the New Jersey Titans, the North Texas
Knockouts, the Savannah Vizionz and the Tri-State Bruisers.

As well as the West Virginia Wildfire, the eight-player division is made up of
the Cape Fear Thunder, the Carolina Freedom, the Desert Fire Cats, the Kansas
City Phoenix, the Las Vegas Heat, the Nevada Storm, the Racine Pirates, the Salt
City Arch Angels and the Ventura Black Widows.

Women 18 years old or older (or 16 and 17, with parents' permission) are
encouraged to try out for the Wildfire. For more information, including
donations or sponsorship opportunities, direct e-mail messages to

BLM prepares for wildfire season

BYLINE: Sarah Reynolds, The Sun, Yuma, Ariz.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 551 words


May 5--Forest and fire officials in Yuma County are bracing for wildfire season,
to be ready in case things heat up in the area.

A wet winter left plenty of vegetation on the ground that has dried out during
the month of March, creating possible tinder for outland fires, according to
U.S. Bureau of Land Management officials.

"It's so hard to say whether this season will be more severe or not. We do know
that we've had prolonged hot and dry weather. We have a lot of wind out there,"
said Lori Cook, spokeswoman for the BLM's Yuma field office.

The field office manages 1.3 million acres in the area, from the Mexican border
to the town of Quartzsite in La Paz County.

Soon, tighter fire restriction will go into place on all that land.

"We are getting ready to start putting out some fire restrictions. They will go
into effect May 14," Cook said.

While Yuma has not dealt with large-scale fires yet, wildfires have already
threatened parts of the state this year.

In the latest blaze, more than 2,000 acres near Grand Canyon National Park were
charred by a fire that broke out Tuesday, according to The Associated Press.

Firefighters in the Rural/Metro Fire Department and the Yuma Fire Department
said they have people ready to deploy in case of a wildfire emergency.

Rural/Metro deals with fires in the outlying areas of the county, from the
recreational spots on the rivers to sparsely populated desert areas.

Amy Smith, spokeswoman for Rural/Metro, said they practice fire control measures
such as controlled burns to keep the danger of wildfires low. They also
encourage the public to do its part to decrease the risk of fire.

Mike Erfert, spokesman for YFD, said they have been fortunate over the past
several years to have the dangers of wildfire reduced somewhat. He said
restoration efforts such as the projects in the Yuma East and West Wetlands have
removed non-native plants and cleared troublesome vegetation that made those
areas danger spots in the past.

Erfert agreed that residents themselves had the most power to stop wildfires
from occurring. He said the vast majority of fires, including the recent Grand
Canyon blaze, are caused by humans.

"The conditions that come along with wildfire season, people can help themselves
like in a residential situation. We had a little bit of a wetter season, so you
might have in some places more grass that grew up or other vegetation that is
dying off and dry. They can cut back vegetation and clean up debris."

Wildfire season typically begins in May and lasts into early fall. In Yuma,
however, the chance of wildfire never really goes away.

"We've been in a drought for such a long time and the temperatures never get
really low," Cook said.

Fire restrictions, set to go into place on BLM land May 14, will include:

--No open fires except in designated recreation sites.

--No smoking except in designated sites or in vehicles.

--No welding or other hot metal work

Weather forecast concerns wildfire officials

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 528 words


Wildfire officials are expressing concern as hot and dry conditions are expected
to remain in place for much of B.C. over the next few days and throughout this
weekend.

There is little rain in the forecast, and with the potential for lightning
activity over much of the province, chief fire information officer Kevin
Skrepnek said weather remains a huge factor as crews attempt to contain the 152
fires burning throughout the province at this time.

With winds gusting up to 40 km/h in some areas, fire officials are expecting
more new fires today given the ideal conditions, which could make for
challenging days ahead.

RELATED : Wildfires have been 'almost unprecedented'

Another 15 new fires broke out on Tuesday, bringing the total number of
wildfires recorded since April 1 to 787. These fires have burned through 379,000
hectares at a cost of $145.2 million.

Skrepnek said the province is weeks ahead of where it should be with accumulated
dryness and with winds expected to continue over the weekend, there could be a
significant increase in fire activity.

Local governments have been asked to prepare for any eventuality - including the
ability to either receive evacuees or to be put on alert as well. Residents
should continue to monitor the weather in their area and watch your local Black
Press website for further updates.

Assistant Deputy Minister Robert Turner with Emergency Management BC said the
Ministry of Children and Families has reopened their office in 100 Mile House at
its regular location and all services are open to the public.

According to RCMP the Okanagan Centre wildfire is believed to have been
deliberately set, and officers are now investigating it as a criminal case of
arson.

At a press conference Wednesday, Cpl. Dan Moskaluk said they have identified a
few groups of recreational users that were in the area on July 15. And anyone
who was in the area and might have photos or video of the area are also urged to
contact police.

"Any photos or video captured by boaters, those on land, motorists, or residents
with closed circuit CT cams, that recorded that day of the fire, we would be
interested in viewing," he said.

Wildfires mean no-fly zones for drones

BYLINE: By, Ruidoso News reports

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A5

LENGTH: 603 words


Officials with federal, state, and local wildland fire agencies and the Federal
Aviation Administration remind the public not to fly "Unmanned Aircraft Systems"
or drones over or near wildfires this season. Unauthorized UAS flights
potentially can cause serious accidents and disrupt aerial firefighting
operations.

To date this year, four reports of unauthorized drone flights over or near
wildfires in the United States and Canada have been received. In 2015, there
were at least 20 documented instances of unauthorized drone flights over or near
wildfires in California, Colorado, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming and Washington,
officials said. Aerial firefighting operations in these states were temporarily
shut down on a minimum of 12 occasions and there were two cases of near misses
with UAS aircraft.

Fire agencies and FAA officials caution that aerial intrusions can unduly
threaten lives, property, and valuable natural and cultural resources.
Interference by unmanned aircraft also may stop firefighting operations and
cause wildfires to become larger and more costly.

"Firefighter and public safety are the top priority in wildfire management," Dan
Buckley, Chair of the National Multi-Agency Coordinating Group at the National
Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, said. "If an unauthorized UAS is
detected flying over or near a wildfire, we may have to ground all airtankers,
helicopters, and other aerial firefighting aircraft until we can confirm that
the UAS has left the area and we are confident it won't be coming back, which
could decrease the effectiveness of wildfire suppression operations."

Aerial firefighting aircraft, such as airtankers and helicopters, fly at very
low altitudes, typically just a couple of hundred feet above the ground and in
the same airspace as UAS aircraft flown by the public. That proximity creates
the potential for a mid-air collision that could seriously injure or kill aerial
and/or ground firefighters.

Temporary Flight Restrictions typically put in place during wildfires require
manned or unmanned aircraft not involved in wildfire suppression operations to
obtain permission from fire managers to enter specified airspace. The FAA, the
U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Department of the Interior and other wildland fire
management agencies consider UAS, including those used by the public for hobby
and recreation purposes, to be aircraft and therefore subject to TFRs.

People should not fly UAS over or near wildfires even if a TFR is not in place,
because of the potential for accidents and disruption of suppression operations.
Individuals who are determined to have interfered with wildfire suppression
efforts may be subject to civil penalties of up to $25,000 and potentially
criminal prosecution, officials said.

To keep UAS pilots aware of flight restrictions, the FAA has developed an
easy-to-use smartphone app called B4UFLY. The app helps unmanned aircraft
operators determine whether there are any restrictions or requirements in effect
at the location where they want to fly. B4UFLY is available for free download in
the App Store for iOS and Google Play store for Android. The app is part of the
"Know Before You Fly" campaign aimed at UAS hobbyists. For more information.
See: www.faa.gov/uas/model_aircraft/.

Wildland fire agencies also use a variety of communication tools to connect with
UAS pilots. The "If You Fly, We Can't" UAS safety awareness campaign, launched
last summer, is designed to keep UAS pilots away from airspace used by
firefighters. If the public witnesses or has information about a safety-related
UAS event, contact local law enforcement.

Reducing fire risk goal of program

BYLINE: Gerald Vander Pyl, For the Calgary Herald

SECTION: RECREATION & INVESTMENT PROPERTIES; Pg. K4

LENGTH: 636  words


For owners of recreation property, the issue of wildfires is something most
people would rather not think about unless they have to.

But the old adage an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure has never been
truer than when applied to making your cabin or cottage as safe from
out-of-control forest fires as possible.

"While picturesque, many cabins nestled in the forest are at an increased risk
due to wildfire," says Rob Harris, wildfire information officer with the
forestry division of Alberta Sustainable Resource Development. "In many cases,
cabins and cottages are located in remote areas of the forest far away from the
fire halls we take for granted in the city."

Harris says wildfires often threaten cabins and sometimes homes and entire
communities in Alberta.

He says earlier this year, residents around Slave Lake and in the community of
Newbrook were evacuated as wildfires burned dangerously close to homes.

"While firefighters do their best to keep the flames from damaging any property,
sometimes environmental factors, like strong winds, make containing wildfires
virtually impossible. That's why it's so important for homeowners to utilize
FireSmart principles around their property."

Harris says the FireSmart program provides property owners with a number of
proactive steps they can take to help reduce the risk from wildfires.

"By creating a FireSmart cabin, you greatly increase the chances for
firefighters to save your property from an advancing wildfire," he says.

A key component to making your recreation property FireSmart is managing the
space around your cabin and keeping flammable vegetation and materials a safe
distance away.

Harris says many people use landscaping to provide privacy for their cabin, but
imagine the potential danger of having fuel sources such as mature trees,
shrubs, grasses and even stacks of fire wood right next to your cabin.

"By moving these flammable materials a safe distance away from buildings, a
property owner can create a fuel-break that will help slow or even stop the
progression of a wildfire. Clearing the space around a home also creates a safe
space for firefighters to work and gives them a better chance at saving a
structure threatened by wildfire."

He says if you are building a new cabin or renovating an old one, you can make
it more FireSmart by making smart choices when it comes to building materials
and design.

The use of fire resistant materials such as metal roofing, stucco siding, closed
in eaves and sheathed decks are all excellent way to construct a FireSmart
cabin.

Other aspects of the FireSmart program cover fire prevention and what to do in
case of a wildfire.

Harris says in Alberta almost half of wildfires each year are caused by human
activity, which means about 50 per cent of the wildfires in Alberta are 100 per
cent preventable.

He says this summer there are a number of things Albertans can do to prevent
being the accidental cause of a wildfire.

First, always check the status of any fire bans in your area by visiting
www.albertafirebans.ca.

Next, get a fire permit for any kind of burning, except campfires. Fire permits
contain specific information on what conditions are best for burning, calm and
cool days, and are available for free from your local Alberta Sustainable
Resource Development office or fire hall.

Also, when burning anything, it's critical that your fire is monitored at all
times, and that the fire is completely extinguished before walking away by
soaking it with water, stirring the ashes and soaking it again.

Harris says when it comes to wildfires, owners of recreation property should
carry adequate insurance on their property, keep some simple firefighting
equipment such as shovels, rakes, buckets, hoses and so on easily accessible --
and have an emergency fire and evacuation plan in place.

Washington: Gardner, Bennet Introduce Bill to Permanently Fix Wildfire Funding

LENGTH: 547  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Senator Cory Gardner has issued the following
news release:

U.S. Senators Cory Gardner (R-CO) and Michael Bennet (D-CO) introduced an
updated version of their bipartisan wildfire funding solution that would provide
desperately needed funding for fire prevention.


"It may not be getting headlines in the national news, but wildfires have burned
millions of acres in the West this year and the communities impacted in Colorado
need assistance," Gardner said. "I've been working to advance this legislation
to stop fire borrowing for several years, and I appreciate the strong bipartisan
support to ensure the Forest Service has the funds it needs for clean-up and
prevention efforts while also finally requiring the government to treat
wildfires like it does other natural disasters."

"Catastrophic wildfires continue to plague the West, not only threatening
communities and livelihoods but also draining the Forest Service budget," Bennet
said. "We need to restructure the way we pay for fighting catastrophic fires to
mitigate and prevent future wildfires. This bill would end the practice of fire
borrowing--a necessary step that will enable the Forest Service to make
responsible investments on the front end to restore our forests and safeguard
our watersheds."

Unlike for other natural disasters, where agencies can draw from an emergency
fund to pay for disaster response, the U.S. Forest Service and Interior
Department do not have access to disaster funds and are forced to "fire borrow"
- or steal money from fire prevention and other important programs already
funded in their agencies to pay to put out fires. The Wildfire Disaster Funding
Act of 2017 would end the destructive cycle of fire borrowing and stop the
erosion of the Forest Service's budget by reforming the way the federal
government funds wildfires.

Currently, federal agencies calculate wildfire suppression budgets based on the
average costs of wildfire suppression over the past 10 years. But as fire
seasons grow longer and wildfires become more expensive to fight, Congress is
forced to appropriate more funding to an outdated budgeting system that almost
always underestimates the actual cost of fighting fires.

This legislation would fund wildfires as natural disasters and protect the
agencies' fire prevention budget by putting a freeze on the rising budget costs
of the 10-year average. It would make funding available after the appropriated
fire suppression funds are spent, allowing the Forest Service to use its fire
prevention funding for its intended purpose - completing hazardous fuels
reduction projects that have been shown to help break the cycle of increasingly
dangerous and costly fires.

Earlier this month, Bennet sent a letter with a bipartisan group of Senators to
Senate Leaders Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Charles Schumer (D-NY) urging them to
include a wildfire funding fix in any future disaster aid legislation that
passes through Congress. Gardner has also directly spoken with McConnell about
the wildfire funding fix.

In addition to Gardner and Bennet, the bill is cosponsored by Senators Ron Wyden
(D-OR), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Jim Risch (R-ID), Maria
Cantwell (D-WA), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR).

Washington: Tester to Introduce Bill to Help Protect Communities Devastated by
Wildfires

LENGTH: 678  words


 Washington: Office of the Senator Jon Tester has issued the following news
release:



 In an effort to help more Montana communities after disaster strikes, Senator
Jon Tester will be introducing new bipartisan legislation that would provide
hazard mitigation resources to communities trying to recover from wildfires and
prevent future natural disasters.





 "We have seen the catastrophic impacts of wildfires across Montana and we must
do more to prevent them and reduce their devastation," Tester said. "We know
that a wildfire doesn't end when the flames stop burning. This bill will provide
additional resources to restore land after a wildfire sweeps through, preventing
future disasters."



 Tester's Wildfire Mitigation Assistance Act would provide FEMA funding to
communities recovering from certain major wildfires so they can take steps like
building erosion barriers, restoring burned land, and improving drainage to help
prevent flooding. Major wildfires leave behind barren, charred soil that is
unable to absorb water from rainfall, which can dramatically increase the threat
of flooding and landslides.



 "I can tell you from first-hand experience how important this bill would be to
our community," Jeff Gates, former Disaster and Emergency Services Coordinator
for Musselshell County, said. "70,000 acres of forest burned down during the
2012 fire season, destroying more than 200 buildings and leaving dozens
homeless. We had very little financial assistance in the aftermath-we were
relying on private donations and volunteers to get these residents back on their
feet-so we certainly couldn't afford any mitigation programs. This left us in a
really vulnerable position the next year, when we experienced more than a dozen
flash floods and numerous mudslides in many of the same areas that had been
burned to the ground the year before. So residents of Roundup know better than
most how important mitigation funding is."



 The Wildfire Mitigation Assistance Act would also provide resources to help
further reduce fuels after a wildfire.



 "Mitigation is an essential part of wildfire response and prevention," Dan
Dennehy, Director of Emergency Management for Butte-Silver Bow said. "So this
bill is critically important to those of us here in Butte, because when you live
in a city surrounded by dead trees due to the pine beetle infiltration, it's not
a question of whether a wildfire will spark, it's a matter a when."



 Federal hazard mitigation funding is currently only available to areas that
have been declared "major disasters," and only a small percentage of fires are
designated this way. Most major wildfires impacting nonfederal lands are
addressed using Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAG), which only provide
resources to fight wildfires but don't provide mitigation costs after a fire.



 So Tester's bill will provide local governments with federal hazard mitigation
funding following a FMAG designation.



 "After receiving an FMAG to help address the cost of fighting the Lolo Creek
Complex Fire back in 2013, we received several requests for mitigation
assistance," Missoula County Commissioner Jean Curtiss said. "The County had
some local funds to help with this but, as always, the need outstripped the
available funding. If Senator Tester's bill had been around back then, Missoula
County and its residents would have been able to apply for mitigation funding to
help supplement local dollars to help create defensible space around their homes
and businesses."



 Tester is introducing the bill along with Senator Michael Bennet (D-Colo.).

 o International Association of Emergency Managers

Washington: Tester to Introduce Bill to Help Protect Communities Devastated by
Wildfires

LENGTH: 678  words


 Washington: Office of the Senator Jon Tester has issued the following news
release:



 In an effort to help more Montana communities after disaster strikes, Senator
Jon Tester will be introducing new bipartisan legislation that would provide
hazard mitigation resources to communities trying to recover from wildfires and
prevent future natural disasters.





 "We have seen the catastrophic impacts of wildfires across Montana and we must
do more to prevent them and reduce their devastation," Tester said. "We know
that a wildfire doesn't end when the flames stop burning. This bill will provide
additional resources to restore land after a wildfire sweeps through, preventing
future disasters."



 Tester's Wildfire Mitigation Assistance Act would provide FEMA funding to
communities recovering from certain major wildfires so they can take steps like
building erosion barriers, restoring burned land, and improving drainage to help
prevent flooding. Major wildfires leave behind barren, charred soil that is
unable to absorb water from rainfall, which can dramatically increase the threat
of flooding and landslides.



 "I can tell you from first-hand experience how important this bill would be to
our community," Jeff Gates, former Disaster and Emergency Services Coordinator
for Musselshell County, said. "70,000 acres of forest burned down during the
2012 fire season, destroying more than 200 buildings and leaving dozens
homeless. We had very little financial assistance in the aftermath-we were
relying on private donations and volunteers to get these residents back on their
feet-so we certainly couldn't afford any mitigation programs. This left us in a
really vulnerable position the next year, when we experienced more than a dozen
flash floods and numerous mudslides in many of the same areas that had been
burned to the ground the year before. So residents of Roundup know better than
most how important mitigation funding is."



 The Wildfire Mitigation Assistance Act would also provide resources to help
further reduce fuels after a wildfire.



 "Mitigation is an essential part of wildfire response and prevention," Dan
Dennehy, Director of Emergency Management for Butte-Silver Bow said. "So this
bill is critically important to those of us here in Butte, because when you live
in a city surrounded by dead trees due to the pine beetle infiltration, it's not
a question of whether a wildfire will spark, it's a matter a when."



 Federal hazard mitigation funding is currently only available to areas that

Washington: Wyden Emphasizes Costs of Congressional Inaction on Wildfire Funding

LENGTH: 381  words



Washington: Office of the Senator Ron Wyden has issued the following news
release:

U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today emphasized the costs of congressional
inaction when it comes to fixing the broken system of wildfire funding, in a
hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee this morning.


Wyden, together with Sens. Mike Crapo and James Risch, both R-Idaho, has been
working on a long-term solution since 2013 to fix the way the federal government
funds wildfire suppression, in order to free up more funding for fire prevention
and other forest management work in Oregon's forests and across the country.
Wyden asked U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell what the costs of inaction on
a long-term wildfire budgeting fix have been on forest management and wildfire
over the last four years.
"This is a broken, common-sense-defying system of fighting fire, where you
borrow from prevention to put the fires out and the problem just gets worse.
This is not some abstract thing," Wyden said. "The costs of inaction are
extraordinary. The bottom line is the Congress cannot let another fire year go
by, with lives and communities at stake, without fixing wildfire budgeting for
good."
Tidwell told Wyden the cost of not having a long-term wildfire budget solution
has prevented the Forest Service from managing millions of forest acres. The
lack of forest management has exacerbated the severity and size of wildfires as
the agency is forced to fund fire suppression by borrowing funds from forest
management programs.
"If you look at it over four years and you look at just the growth of the
10-year average, we could have easily been treating millions of more acres over
the last four years. We have the science, we have the experience and we have
study after study that shows that our projects are effective to reduce the cost
of wildfires," Tidwell said. "There are independent studies that show that this
work makes a difference and that we can reduce the size of wildfires by anywhere
from 30 - 70 percent, and on average, 41 percent, by getting out there and doing
the work."
Wyden and Crapo are continuing to work toward a wildfire funding solution to
bring down the cost of wildfire fighting by focusing on prevention and other
forest management work.

Calhoun County gets reprieve from wildfires, not from drought

BYLINE: Patrick McCreless, The Anniston Star, Ala.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 546 words


Nov. 23--No new wildfires had been reported for Calhoun County on Wednesday as
of 2 p.m., but there likely won't be any rainfall until next week to help
suppress any from sparking, meteorologists predict.

The news comes after a month of wildfires brought on by the extreme drought,
including three fires on Tuesday.

According to the Alabama Forestry Commission's website, there were three
wildfires reported in the county that burned about 85 acres Tuesday. Meanwhile,
the website showed that as of 2 p.m. Wednesday, no new wildfires had been
reported for the day.

Oxford Fire Chief Gary Sparks said his department didn't receive any wildfire
calls Wednesday.

"We have had no grass or wood fires," Sparks said.

Lt. Robin Hubbard with the Anniston Fire Department said his firefighters had no
drought-related fire calls on Wednesday.

"We haven't had anything like that in the last couple of days," Hubbard said.

Gloria Nielsen, district ranger for the Talladega National Forest, said there
were no new wildfires Wednesday in the county.

"But we are having a bit of a reburn of five acres at a previous wildfire south
of Cheaha State Park because of needle fall," Nielsen said. "We're continuing to
monitor all our fires."

According to the National Weather Service, as of Wednesday the county had
received 26.47 inches of rain, more than 17 inches below average for the year.

Gary Goggins, meteorologist with the Weather Service, said the county shouldn't
expect any significant rain until Tuesday or Wednesday. He said a new rain
pattern was developing that could cover all of central Alabama next week.

"It's possible you might see over an inch of rain," Goggins said. "You might
even have a thunderstorm too."

Goggins noted that any rainfall next week would do little to alleviate the
drought or reduce the burn bans in the state.

Gov. Robert Bentley in October issued a burn ban for 46 counties in Alabama. The
directive was later expanded to the entire state earlier this month.

"We're going to need several months of multiple rainfall events in here,"
Goggins said.

Bentley on Monday announced $690,000 in emergency funds for the forestry
commission and local fire departments to fight wildfires. That money is needed
to offset heavy costs associated with those fires, according to a press release
from Bentley on Monday.

Firefighters have battled 1,055 wildfires that have consumed 11,376 acres
statewide over the last 30 days, according to the forestry commission. During
that same time, the county has had 18 wildfires that have burned more than 249
acres.

Currently, more than 82 percent of the state is under the two highest levels of
drought, according to the U.S Drought Monitor report released Wednesday. Calhoun
is under exceptional drought, the highest level.

Sparks said his department has had 56 calls for brush, wood or rubbish fires
since the start of October. Typically, his department has 15 such calls in
October and November.

"We've seen some dry weather, but it's been pretty bad this year," Sparks said.
"This could be the worst I've ever seen."

WILDFIRE SCHOOL IN GLYNN;
Investigators undergo training at FLETC

BYLINE: Teresa Stepzinski, The Times-Union

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B-1

LENGTH: 531 words


BRUNSWICK -- Down on their hands and knees, a group of men and women carefully
sniffed and sifted 15 scorched patches of earth Wednesday at the Federal Law
Enforcement Training Center.

Their faces barely an inch above each burn, they gently probed the charred
debris with a pen or pencil, hoping to reveal the tiniest clue to the cause of
each mini-fire.

"That looks like some kind of alien artifact," said one man as he examined a
small, melted wad of plastic, which he would learn was used in a chemical
reaction to start the fire.

The 18 students are investigators from several federal and state agencies, all
training this week in how to investigate wildland fires. The training consists
of classroom instruction and field exercises involving controlled burns based on
real wildfires nationwide.

The students learn fire behavior and burn pattern indicators, arson detection,
proper evidence collection, how to interview witnesses and how to prepare for
courtroom testimony, instructors said.

Investigators who graduate from the program will be responsible for determining
and documenting the cause of a wildfire.

Wildfires are generally more complex and tougher to investigate than structure
fires, said Mike Heath, senior instructor with FLETC's Forensics and
Investigative Techniques Division.

"A structure fire is confined to one spot . . . whereas a wildland fire is
moving and spread out over a wide area," Heath said.

"You investigate a wildland fire differently than a structure fire. In a
wildland fire, you go to the most intensely burned area and work your way back
to the least intensely burned, which usually, more often than not, is where the
wildfire started."

The course was developed because of the frequency and size of recent wildfires
nationwide, instructors said.

Wildfires nationwide have burned at least 28,149 acres in blazes battled by
federal agency firefighters from Jan. 1 to Feb. 25, according to the most recent
statistics from the National Interagency Fire Center.

Meanwhile, wildfires have burned about 5,250 acres from Jan. 1 through Wednesday
in Georgia, according to state Forestry Commission data.

Last year, Georgia wildfires destroyed about 35,125 acres.

Accurately identifying the cause of a wildfire, instructors said, is important
for fire prevention.

It is also essential for successful prosecution in arson cases, and for the
recovery of firefighting costs or reimbursement for property damage if the
wildfire resulted from negligence, they said.

FLETC has provided the Wildland Fire Origin and Cause Determination Training
Program since its inception in November 2003.

The course has graduated several hundred certified investigators, Heath said.

The program is taught throughout the year at FLETC's main campus near Brunswick,
as well at sites around the country.

"We are in the process of developing the next level of training for the
program," Heath said.

Nepal to call national emergency over 420 forest fires

LENGTH: 271 words


Excerpt from report by privately-owned Nepalnews.com website on 27 April

Satellite imagery from US space agency NASA on Sunday [16 April] showed at least
420 forests across the country blazing under wildfire. Similar picture on
Saturday had shown wildfire in 400 places. Nepal's wildfire is the largest and
most dangerous in South Asia, according to the pictures taken by NASA. [passage
omitted]

Experts and concerned officials met at the Ministry of Forest and Soil
Conservation Sunday to discuss the growing crisis ensued by the wildfires. As
per the advice of the experts, the ministry has decided to recommend the Home
Ministry to declare a national crisis to help take the wildfires in control.

It has been necessary to launch a national campaign to control such wildfires by
declaring a national crisis and consulting all government agencies, Dr Krishna
Chandra Poudel, director of Department of Forests, said.

The department has directed all district forest offices to start taking the
wildfires in control by coordinating with the district administration, Nepal
Army, Nepal police and the locals.

Even though wildfires are normal phenomenon during the dry season in Nepal,
incidents of wildfires have increased markedly this year compared to the
previous year due to the prolonged drought.

Dozens of people have already lost their lives this year due to fire-related
accidents. Thirteen army personnel were burnt to death in Ramechhap on Thursday
and five locals in Gulmi died on Saturday when they were trying to extinguish
wildfires in their area respectively.

BC Wildfire crews attack new wildfire near Pantage Lake northwwest of Quesnel

BYLINE: Monica Lamb-Yorski

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 205 words


The BC Wildfire Service is responding to a new 50-hectare wildfire about five
kilometres south of Pantage Lake and 40 kilometres northwest of Quesnel that has
been classified as "out of control"

Reported on Sunday, June 4, the wildfire does not pose an immediate threat to
public safety or property at this time, said fire information officer Natasha
Broznitsky in a press release.

Crews began fighting the fire Sunday and are now being supported by air tankers,
a helicopter and heavy equipment. Thirty-seven firefighters are currently
working to establish control lines around the perimeter.

As of Monday morning the fire was zero per cent contained and its cause is under
investigation.

The BC Wildfire Service strongly urges members of the public to stay well away
from the area where this wildfire is burning, since their presence could put the
safety of firefighting crews and others at risk. Public access to a wildfire
site is not allowed during fire suppression operations, under the provisions of
the Wildfire Act and WorkSafeBC regulations.

DNR ready for wildfire season

BYLINE: John Myers, Duluth News Tribune

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 583 words


April 14--It's been an average start to the Minnesota wildfire season so far but
a trend to warmer, drier weather in recent months has firefighting officials on
the alert.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources on Thursday said it was ready to
do battle on land and in the air, noting last year's dead grass and leaves are
ready to burn.

Rain forecast for Friday night and Tuesday should help. But those fine "fuels"
like grass and leaves can dry out in just an hour of sun and wind, and with
moisture in northern conifer needles now at its seasonal low, small fires can
grow into big ones fast.

Minnesota's statewide temperatures are running more than 6 degrees above normal
for April, DNR officials said Thursday, and the state on average is nearly a
half-inch below normal for rain. Duluth is nearly an inch below normal
precipitation since February and has seen an average April temperature more than
8 degrees above normal.

The DNR has ground crews now at the ready at dozens of forestry offices across
the state and 11 water-dropping helicopters and 8 water-bombing airplanes
stationed at multiple airports. Contract aircraft now are flying grids nearly
every day, with trained pilots ready to spot any smoke and dispatch crews
quickly.

Other agencies also are ready to roll and fly on fires -- from local volunteer
fire departments to the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Fish
& Wildlife Service and National Park Service all with personnel and resources
available across the northern third of the state.

Some 98 percent Minnesota's wildfires are caused by humans. Officials urged
caution by anyone burning brush or debris piles, which in some cases are not
allowed. In addition to debris fires, dryer conditions can see fires caused by
careless smokers, train sparks and even small engines such as ATVs or chainsaws.

"We're approaching that kind of dryness now in the northern part of the state
where equipment can cause a fire," said Ron Stoffel, the DNR's wildfire
suppression manager.

Officials also urged people not to try to fight wildfires once they start,
noting several people have been injured in recent years. Get out of danger and
call 911, they noted, and let wildfire crews do the job. One man recently
suffered severe burns attempting to put out a wildfire that spread after his
lawnmower caught fire.

Fire officials also urged people not to fly drones anywhere near a wildfire
because of the chances of collision with low-flying fire suppression aircraft.
If a drone is spotted, fire aircraft are pulled out of the area, allowing the
fire to spread.

Minnesota by far sees its most wildfires in April and May, before new green
growth emerges among grass, bushes and trees. The worst wildfire days are warm
and windy, but any extended period without rain can see fires increase.

There were 387 fires reported through Wednesday across the state so far this
year, burning across 1,087 acres, mostly grass and brush. So far those fires
have been, small, usually snuffed by crews when they are just a few acres in
size, said Paul Lundgren, the DNR's wildfire section manager.

The current fire danger is listed as moderate in most of Northeastern Minnesota
and Northwestern Wisconsin.

Nationally 2016 has been a hot one so far, with 13,458 wildfires reported, up 46
percent from this time last year.

Oct. 19--SOUTHPORT -- Waving arms symbolized fire.

"How were you started, little wildfire?" Brian Goddin, wildfire mitigation
specialist Florida Forest Service, asked Deane Bozeman students Friday at a
wildfire education presentation.

The 10 young volunteers listed wildfire causes -- from a hot vehicle being
parked on dry grass to unattended debris to arson.

"There's a lot more wildfire than people realize," Goddin said, noting nine out
of 10 fires are started by humans and can, therefore, be prevented by humans.

He said a record wet summer has kept the state's number of wildfires low, but
spreading the word about wildfire prevention still is important.

The firefighter's message to Bozeman students was simple: "Only you can prevent
wildfires.

"Bozeman school is set in a rural part of Bay County; there's a lot of trees,
brush and woods around," Goddin said. "This is certainly a good target audience
for our wildland firefighters."

Through a skit, video, Q&A and interactive demonstrations, students learned
about how wildfires are started, controlled and prevented.

But Smokey Bear was the highlight.

About midway into the presentation, prompted by a ranger, students yelled
"Smokey, Smokey, Smokey" and from a side hallway, out popped Smokey Bear,
wearing his trademark blue jeans and ranger hat.

The audience went wild.

"It was fun," said fourth-grader Nicholas Harrison, noting it wasn't his first
time meeting the bear.

He learned to "always do fires with adult supervision," Nicholas added.

After the presentation, the students were escorted to a field to view a
bulldozer and plow used to put out wildfires when water is not an option.

"If we can reach them on this level and make it fun for them, they'll realize
just how dangerous that wildfire is," Goddin said. "As these kids grow up,
they'll remember Smokey Bear. ... It might help them make a decision in the
future that, 'Hey, we better not leave that campfire unattended; we better put
that fire out.' It's those kinds of fires that can cause massive damage and
massive destruction."

State foresters push wildfire precautions;
They warn of gusty winds that can spread burning embers.

BRUNSWICK - Just as warm, breezy spring days can be perfect for hiking, camping
and picnicking, so too are they ideal conditions for wildfires.

Georgia Forestry Commission rangers are reminding residents and tourists to take
extra precautions when clearing land, burning yard debris, using an outdoor
grill or camp fires.

"Half of all the wildfires in Georgia every year happen between January and
April," said Greg Strenkowski, commission staff forester.

Since Jan. 1, a reported 1,287 wildfires statewide have burned 4,411 acres.
Those blazes include 198 that have burned an estimated 577 acres throughout the
15 Southeast Georgia counties that comprise the commission's Waycross district,
state records show.

"The No. 1 cause of wildfire is escaped debris burning," Strenkowski said. "Wind
carries sparks and Georgia's largest and most damaging wildfires have been
recorded on windy April days."

In April 2007, the largest wildfires in state history burned about 560,000 acres
across Southeast Georgia. The initial fire was sparked by a downed power line on
Sweat Farm Road in Ware County. Burning embers carried by shifting, gusty winds
ignited several related blazes; other wildfires in the region were arson or
caused by lightning.

Last year's rain eased state's drought and soaked Southeast Georgia, which
reduced the risk of winter wildfires.

PIECEMEAL PERMITS

The latest fire danger ranges from low along the Georgia-Florida line from the
coast to Lowndes County, to high inland in portions of Pierce and Wayne
counties, according to the forestry commission.

The commission is issuing burn permits according to daily conditions. People
need such a permit before they burn debris, Strenkowski said.

Mid-morning to early afternoon is the best time to burn yard debris if the
weather permits. A 25-foot barrier should be raked around the burning pile, and
emergency equipment such as a water hose, shovel or other hand tools should be
nearby to prevent the fire from spreading. People should never leave the fire
unattended, Strenkowski said.

Permits aren't necessary for grills or camp fires in designated areas, but
people should be cautious when using them. They need to make sure the fire is
out and the ashes are cool to the touch before leaving the area, he said.

Strenkowski also said people should remove dead leaves, grass and straw from
rooftops and decks. If people have utility poles on their property, they should
remove any flammable material from around the base, he said.

More information about safe burning practices is available at the commission's
Web site, www.gatrees.org, or by contacting the forestry commission office in
each county.

Wildfires more destructive than last year; 'Hectic' season sees dramatic
increase in amount of forest consumed by blazes

BYLINE: Otiena Ellwand and Alexandra Zabjek, Edmonton Journal

SECTION: CANADA &; WORLD; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 549 words

DATELINE: EDMONTON


Alberta's wildfire season is only three months in and already it has consumed
significantly more forest than last year.

So far this season there have been 720 wildfires in the province, burning just
under 30,000 hectares of forest, compared to 400 fires at this time last year,
which burned about 700 hectares.

"The actual amount of forest that's been consumed is dramatically different ...
It's been a significant increase in terms of activity," said Wildfire
Information Officer Richard Horne, adding that the majority of those fires have
been caused by humans.

The wildfire season, which began March 1, has been "very, very hectic," with
some firefighters working up to 24 days straight, said Horne.

"The forested areas of the province have been incredibly dry, so much so that
our meteorologists are talking about this being almost unprecedented," he said
at the Lesser Slave Lake Fire Centre on Wednesday.

All evacuation orders related to wildfires raging in Alberta were lifted as of
Wednesday afternoon, but 15 wildfires are still burning out of control,
including one that has been creeping toward oil and gas infrastructure near Cold
Lake, Scott Long from the Alberta Emergency Management Agency told a news
conference. Cenovus and CNRL both have operations in the area.

"There's no rain; that's the biggest concern certainly for the foreseeable
future. The conditions remain dry and there is the possibility of further
lightning strikes in the coming days," Long said, adding that shifting winds
could further complicate the situation for fire crews. "They're doing their best
to make sure it does not impinge on any oil and gas infrastructure."

Wildfire information manager Geoff Driscoll said the fire grew in size to about
17,000 hectares as of Wednesday, from 10,000 hectares on Tuesday. However, the
blaze remained five kilometres away from oil operations, the same distance it
was before.

As of Wednesday, about 250 firefighters and 10 helicopters were fighting the
blaze, which is still considered out of control and is expected to keep growing
in the days ahead. At least some of 150 extra firefighters coming to Alberta
from other provinces are expected to be deployed to the Cold Lake fire.

"We have been increasing the amount of resources at this fire each day,"
Driscoll said.

Further west, the wildfire near Wabasca that forced the evacuation of almost
5,000 people is now "being held." Long credited "numerous and significant
perimeter guards" that firefighters have worked on over the last 72 hours on the
west, south and east sides of the fire.

The reception centres in Athabasca and Calling Lake are still open, but he said
there is a co-ordinated "re-entry" for residents.

Premier Rachel Notley is getting briefed on the wildfire threats daily.

"Of course, we're very concerned. We know that Albertans across the province are
concerned," Notley said in Calgary. She said she was pleased to learn evacuation
orders were lifted for residents. "But we know this is a critical issue, that it
requires constant attention and oversight and that's why I've asked to be
briefed every day."

The Alberta government's provincial operations centre is running in Edmonton,
for the first time since the 2011 Slave Lake fire disaster. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2015

Arizona: ADOT, Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service,
Bureau of Indian Affairs, other agencies launch wildfire awareness campaign

LENGTH: 420  words

DATELINE: Phoenix


Department of Transportation, The State of Arizona has issued the following
press release:

One Less Spark One Less Wildfire. That's the name of an interagency campaign
that the Arizona Department of Transportation will participate in to raise
driver awareness of their role in preventing wildfires.

The "One Less Spark One Less Wildfire" awareness campaign was started by the
U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies in California in 2012.
The campaign focuses on the role drivers and home owners play in helping to
prevent wildfires.

The campaign offers tips for drivers when traveling this summer to prevent
starting fires:

Do not park in tall grass as the heat from parts under your vehicle can start a
fire
    Make sure nothing is hanging from underneath your vehicle and dragging on
the asphalt
    Dragging chains from towing can cause sparks. Never substitute parts when
towing.
    Check tire pressure before you travel. Exposed wheel rims can cause sparks
on the asphalt.

"The One Less Spark One Less Wildfire campaign is targeted for areas of
high-frequency fires or areas that have the potential for catastrophic wildfire
damage. It was successfully implemented in California in 2012 and is now
expanding to the southwest region," said Justin Haynes with the U.S. Forest
Service. "The program emphasis targets human-caused wildfires, with not only the
continued education in campfire vigilance when recreating, but also focuses on
wildfires caused by vehicles and home owners."

The campaign features posters, bumper stickers, informational cards and public
service announcements which give safety messages about equipment, including
vehicles, sparking wildfires along roadways.

#   #   #

There will be an upcoming media event about the "One Less Spark One Less
Wildfire" campaign. The public is welcome to attend. Details are as follows:

WHO: ADOT, U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Black Canyon City
Fire Department, American Red Cross, Arizona Department of Public Safety and
other agencies

WHERE: Sunset Point Rest Area located along I-17 at milepost 252 north of the
Phoenix area.

WHEN: Friday, May 23 from 1 - 4 p.m.

WHAT: The purpose of the media day is to educate the traveling public that
vehicles can cause fires and provide ways to prevent it. ADOT and other agencies
will have representatives available to talk about the danger of wildfires,
things that cause wildfires and the role the public plays in preventing them.

Lightning-caused fires nearly double

BYLINE: Mary Frances Hill, Vancouver Sun

SECTION: WESTCOAST NEWS; Pg. A11

LENGTH: 487  words


British Columbia is being hit with an explosive growth in wildfires caused by
lightning, with 2,161 lightning-fuelled fires ignited since April 1.

The number represents an 84-per-cent jump over the entire 2008 fire season, and
is far higher than 2004, which recorded the second-highest number of wildfires
caused by lightning in the last 10 years.

Between April 1 and September 7, B.C. has had 3,002 wildfires. Of those, 72 per
cent were caused by lightning, according to the B.C. Wildfire Management branch.

The remaining 28 per cent were caused by humans, most often campers.

The 2004 wildfire season saw 2,394 fires, 71.6 of which were caused by
lightning, according to provincial reports.

The years 2005 to 2007 saw considerably less damage caused by lightning: 41 per
cent, 58 per cent and 61 per cent of lightning-caused fires, respectively.

Wildfire season runs from April 1 to the end of September or early October, when
cooler weather takes hold, according to B.C. Wildfire Management branch
spokeswoman Allison Couch.

Wildfire management branch spokeswoman Kim Steinbart said that in a usual
season, 60 per cent of wildfires are caused by lightning, and 40 per cent by
people.

She said that this season, with relatively few blazes caused by campers "it's
hard to know if there are more lightning storms or if people are being more
cautious."

In 2003, wildfires ripped through 225,000 hectares in the Okanagan, damaging and
destroying many homes.

That year, the province saw 2,300 fires -- 61 per cent of which had been caused
by lightning.

Although that's less than this year's tally, the 2003 fires were more
threatening because more of those were "interface fires" -- blazes that strike
residential areas.

"Dry lightning," which strikes without a sign of rain or storms, posed a big
threat to B.C. forests in this hot, dry season, said Couch.

Couch and Steinbart said they couldn't explain why lightning caused so many
fires this year, aside from the hot, dry conditions in the forests.

"There's not a whole lot you can do. Mother Nature will do what she wants to
do," said Couch.

An article in the January 2009 issue of New Scientist magazine notes studies in
the U.S. showing that lightning can also be caused by car exhaust fumes.

Researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which presented the
research last December at the American Geophysical Union meeting, counted
lightning strikes for the 10-year period June to August, from 1998 to 2008.

In the southeastern United States, lightning strikes increased with pollution by
as much as 25 per cent during the working week, the research found.

B.C. Forest Services use lightning locators to pinpoint the latitude and
longitude of lighting strikes and plot them on maps to determine lightning "hot
spots" so they can move their firefighters and equipment quickly.

On one single day last week, Sept. 2, lightning strikes across B.C. ignited 116
fires.

MS Forestry Commission Deploys Wildland Firefighters to Oklahoma

BYLINE: Mississippi Forestry Commission

LENGTH: 565  words


Jackson, MS,  March 17, 2018 --(PR.com)-- The Mississippi Forestry Commission
(MFC) is deploying a bulldozer strike team and two division supervisors to
Oklahoma to assist state and federal partners with wildfire suppression efforts.
Eight MFC Wildland Firefighters traveled overnight to Shawnee, Oklahoma the
morning of Friday, March 16, 2018.

"We are extremely proud of our employees who are taking part in these efforts to
help our state and federal partners in Oklahoma. Fighting the destructive power
of wildfire means that our Wildland Firefighters are working in extreme
conditions protecting people's lives, homes, and forestland," said Charlie
Morgan, State Forester. "We wish them a safe trip and look forward to their
return home in approximately two weeks."

Oklahoma has several active wildfires, including one that is estimated to have
burned more than 27,650 acres across Colorado, New Mexico, and Oklahoma
(Stateline Fire). At this time, the west half of Oklahoma is under a burn ban.
With exhausted resources and high winds in the forecast, several states are
headed to help under the South Central Interstate Forest Fire Protection
Compact. These states include Mississippi, Louisiana, Kentucky, Georgia, and
Alabama.

How the Mississippi Forestry Commission fights wildfires

MFC Wildland Firefighters "fight fire with fire." They plow a fire line (aka
fire break) with bulldozers around the perimeter of the wildfire, then light a
controlled backfire along the inner edge of the fire line to consume the
vegetation - this lack of "fuel" for the wildfire creates a barrier to slow or
stop the spread of the wildfire. However, their job is not yet finished - even
after containment has been reached, wildland firefighters continue to monitor
the area. Since the wind can spread hot embers across fire lines, new spot fires
may occur as far away as one-half mile from the original wildfire that must be
suppressed. Depending on the size, location, wind conditions, and intensity of
the wildfire - it may have to be monitored anywhere from several hours to
several days to make sure the wildfire is no longer a threat to life, property,
or forestland.

To learn more about wildfires in Mississippi, please visit the MFC's website
(www.mfc.ms.gov) and follow us on social media: YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and
Instagram.

About the Mississippi Forestry Commission

Established in 1926, the Mississippi Forestry Commission, (MFC) protects the
state's valuable forest resources from wildfire, manages approximately 480,000
acres of forested School Trust Land, and delivers quality forest management
services and assistance to both rural and urban landowners. Our mission is to
provide active leadership in forest protection, forest management, forest
inventory, and effective forest information distribution, necessary for
Mississippi's sustainable forest-based economy. The MFC looks forward to the
continued privilege of caring for Mississippi's trees, forests, and natural
resources. There are approximately 19.8 million forested acres in Mississippi.
Mississippi's forestry and forest products industries have a $12.79 billion
economic impact and employs almost 70,000 people. Forestry consistently ranks as
the state's second most valuable agricultural commodity, right behind the
poultry industry.

Cumberland gets new wildfire policy

BYLINE: Gordon Jackson, The Brunswick News, Ga.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 439 words


Feb. 20--ST. MARYS -- The National Park Service has approved a new fire
management plan for Cumberland Island National Seashore that's designed to
reduce the risk of a wildfire raging out of control.

"This is a big step forward in how we implement fire management on Cumberland
Island," Superintendent Gary Ingram said. "This plan and environmental
assessment were developed with the goal of restoring wildland fire to its
natural role in the ecology of the island while protecting the cultural and
natural resources. It will also protect property and, most important of all,
human safety."

The new plan will alleviate many concerns by park service officials who have
known for years the former fire plan was outdated.

Wildfires in most federal wilderness areas are allowed to burn until they
threaten structures and private property.

Studies have shown that extinguishing wildfires automatically worsens the risk
because shrubs, bushes, smaller trees and other undergrowth that fuel a wildfire
continue to build up.

When forests with lots of fuel on the ground catch fire, the results are often
volatile.

Wildfires are part of the natural cycle of a forest, cleaning the forest floor,
allowing the growth of new plants and creating new habitat for wildlife by
enriching the soil.

The policy on Cumberland Island has been to extinguish wildfires as quickly as
possible. That policy will continue under the new plan because wildfires "pose
an unacceptable risk" to tourists, residents, firefighters and structures, both
public and private.

Several alternatives, including continuing the same fire policy, were
considered.

The new plan will rely on a combination of controlled burns, the use of
mechanical and hand tools and herbicides to reduce the forest undergrowth.

Anywhere from 10 to 1,500 acres are prescribed for controlled burns each year.
Another option considered would have allowed wildfires caused by lightning to
burn, but that alternative was rejected because it was considered too risky.

Vegetation and habitat have been altered on the island through the general
practice of suppressing all wildland fires.

Fully excluding fire from the fire-adapted ecosystems of the island has allowed
the growth of unnaturally thick stands of volatile vegetation, with related
debris, that burns intensely in wildfires, researchers found.

WATCH: Northumberland hosts international wildfire event

BYLINE: Ben O'connell

LENGTH: 339  words


Northumberland Fire and Rescue Service hosted an international training
exercise, incorporating virtual-reality wildfire training using a simulation
tool, involving partners from France, Italy and Portugal.

The Initiative for Global Management of big fires through Simulation (IGNIS)
programme project is funded by the European Commission and provides fire
officers and incident commanders with a virtual-reality setting to train
real-life incident commanders on how to command and control large-scale and
complex wildfire incidents.

The purpose of the tool is to provide a virtual reality setting in which
different parts of the command system work together, replicating management of a
real-life wildfire and ultimately keeping people safe.

This is the first event in the UK which uses a virtual-reality tool to manage
wildfires and following the development of this tool, the training tool and
packages can be used within partner countries and across Europe to train fire
officers in wildfire management.

Paul Hedley, Chief Fire Officer at Northumberland Fire and Rescue Service, said:
"We are proud to have been involved in the development of this virtual-reality
training tool along with our international partners and to also be the lead
service in the UK for tackling wildfires.

"Wildfires can have devastating effects and it is paramount that we know how to
manage and suppress them effectively when they arise, which we are able to do
through the use of this training tool which allows us to work with all areas of
command and our international agencies to coordinate the effective management of
a wildfire."

John Riddle, cabinet member for planning, housing and resilience at
Northumberland County Council, said: "We are delighted to host this training
event and welcome partners from across Europe to our facility at West Hartford,
Cramlington, working together to set up various virtual-reality wildfire
training scenarios, combating the fire and preparing the fire and rescue service
should a wildfire occur in Northumberland."

WATCH: Northumberland hosts international wildfire event

BYLINE: Ben O'connell

LENGTH: 339  words


Northumberland Fire and Rescue Service hosted an international training
exercise, incorporating virtual-reality wildfire training using a simulation
tool, involving partners from France, Italy and Portugal.

The Initiative for Global Management of big fires through Simulation (IGNIS)
programme project is funded by the European Commission and provides fire
officers and incident commanders with a virtual-reality setting to train
real-life incident commanders on how to command and control large-scale and
complex wildfire incidents.

The purpose of the tool is to provide a virtual reality setting in which
different parts of the command system work together, replicating management of a
real-life wildfire and ultimately keeping people safe.

This is the first event in the UK which uses a virtual-reality tool to manage
wildfires and following the development of this tool, the training tool and
packages can be used within partner countries and across Europe to train fire
officers in wildfire management.

Paul Hedley, Chief Fire Officer at Northumberland Fire and Rescue Service, said:
"We are proud to have been involved in the development of this virtual-reality
training tool along with our international partners and to also be the lead
service in the UK for tackling wildfires.

"Wildfires can have devastating effects and it is paramount that we know how to
manage and suppress them effectively when they arise, which we are able to do
through the use of this training tool which allows us to work with all areas of
command and our international agencies to coordinate the effective management of
a wildfire."

John Riddle, cabinet member for planning, housing and resilience at
Northumberland County Council, said: "We are delighted to host this training
event and welcome partners from across Europe to our facility at West Hartford,
Cramlington, working together to set up various virtual-reality wildfire
training scenarios, combating the fire and preparing the fire and rescue service
should a wildfire occur in Northumberland."

The rising intensity of wildfires in the West

Re: "No one can manage Western wildfires anymore," July 10 Perspective article.

Allison Linville writes a disturbing account of a new breed of forest fire in
the West. The five worst fire years occurred within the last 10 years, while
acreage consumed has increased. Strained response capabilities contend with
fires that move at tornado speed.

It is clear that short term responses are losing effectiveness and endangering
firefighters. Key causes of increased fire hazard longer fire seasons, reduced
snowpack, hotter summers, and erratic storms are consequences of climate change.
Long term approaches are now needed to deal with the warming caused by release
of greenhouse gases from combustion of hydrocarbon fuels. The U.S. Congress can
lead by imposing a fee on hydrocarbon production, thereby gradually limiting the
release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Meanwhile, it will be a long, hot, smoky summer. Again.

Phil Nelson, Golden

Allison Linville seems to suggest nothing can be done to mitigate or prevent the
extreme, catastrophic wildfires we are experiencing. Even if wildfire modeling
is an inexact science, we know what is fueling these fires, and what we can do
to influence their behavior.

Drought and climate change are contributing factors to catastrophic wildfire. So
are beetle infestations and unnaturally overstocked forest stands. Active forest
management whether through timber harvest, thinning or prescribed fire is proven
to help reduce fuel loads and lessen the severity of fire. Unfortunately, the
Forest Service has lacked the resources, as well as policy and legal tools to
expedite needed forest restoration projects. We should encourage Congress to
address these problems.

Firefighters deserve our thanks for putting themselves in harm's way to protect
others. Though fire is often an unpredictable force, we can improve fire
management through proactive forest management.

Molly Pitts, SalidaThe writer is Rocky Mountain States director of Healthy
Forests, Healthy Communities.

Allison Linville's commentary listed a number of factors that make Western
wildfires no longer controllable hot summers, long fire seasons, low snowpack,
heavy fuel loading, e.g. beetle killed stands of forest, ignorant public,
erratic storms.

There are two additional and relevant factors that make uncontrollable wildfires
a major concern developers who continue to market home sites in rugged mountain
areas with non existent capabilities to control wildfires and county
commissioners who continue to approve development/home site permits, e.g.
Nederland. And who should pay for firefighting resources for such irresponsible
behavior, not to mention the risk to firefighters?

Martin Allen, Centennial

As I witness the massive Beaver Creek wildfire in Jackson County, I read with
great interest the article by Allison Linville on Western wildfires. I certainly
concur with her frightening assessment of modern wildfire in the Western United
States. We are extremely grateful and supportive of the men and women putting
their lives on the line and fighting this wildfire to protect us.

As sure as the uncertainties of the predictability of these fires are the
uncertainties of the restoration of these forest environments. How will areas of
intense heat caused by the massive build up of beetle infested dead trees for
fuel be able to recover? Will the restoration process be delayed by severe
sterilization of soil? I think the environmental consequence of the Beaver Creek
fire is as uncertain as the predictability of the fire itself. I also think
management of our forest without active and well thought out timber sales with
reasonable regulation is a mistake and will allow my grandchildren of North Park
to witness the obliteration by wildfire the next generation of our forests and
the economic and social costs this brings to their rural lives.

It is my opinion, the moment of ignition for the Beaver Creek fire actually
began 25 years ago when the U.S. Forest Service began limiting the ability of
the timber industry, by policy and regulation, to sustain itself.

Trivial examples of America's supposed lack of freedom

Re: "Will our children know freedom?," July 10 Ross Kaminsky column.

Ross Kaminsky's column is a condescending affront to any person who has ever
truly lived without freedom, in bondage, as hundreds of thousands of people (if
not millions) still do today, as a result of human trafficking.

The examples listed ("safe zones" on college campuses, suspension of male
students who commit sexual assault, and overregulation of the economy) are
relative trivialities in a person's ability to live a fulfilling life, if they
are even true at all. Indeed, estimates say that one in five women will be
victims of rape in their lifetime and, yet, a tiny few men are disciplined by
universities for rape. Even fewer face criminal charges. As in the case of the
Stanford sexual assault publicized recently, even perpetrators caught red handed
face weak consequences.

The bottom line is that we really do enjoy great freedoms in this country, and
to think otherwise is to be complacent about the past and present history of
human civilization.

Save democracy by rejecting Trump and electing Clinton?

Re: "Making the case against Trump," July 10 Dottie Lamm column.

Re: "Making the case against Donald Trump," July 10 Dottie Lamm column.

Dottie Lamm's column last Sunday really brought home for me the hypocrisy that
is the "progressive" Democrats in this country. She decries the threat to
democracy that Donald Trump supposedly represents, yet is silent on the
obfuscation that Hillary Clinton pulled during the investigation into Benghazi
and her use of e mail as secretary of state. Clinton refused to honestly answer
questions of her malfeasance in each of these matters. These were questions that
were presented to her by the people's representatives which is their job.

Tom Beard, Aurora

* * *

How ironic that the former first lady of Colorado would ask the question, "Are
we up to the task of saving democracy?" and then two paragraphs later unleash an
ugly, hate filled, personal attack on Donald Trump. Unfortunately, Dottie Lamm
has chosen to continue to broadcast the personal vitriol and poison that
continues to divide the political parties of this state and country. Instead of
a negative column, why not instead write a positive column for making the case
for Hillary Clinton? Why not "proselytize the disenfranchised," as Lamm puts it,
by extolling the virtues, accomplishments and qualifications for her candidate
and then allow us, the voters, to decide for ourselves who is the most qualified
to lead the country. Isn't that the way a democracy is supposed to work?

Timothy Frick, Elizabeth

* * *

While trying to make her case against Donald Trump, Dottie Lamm has
inadvertently made the case against all politicians. They don't listen and they
don't do what they promise to get into office in the first place. In short, they
lie and then try to find ways to make us agree with their solutions to the
problems that their actions caused because they acted contrary to what they said
they would do in the first place. So now, Lamm says, the Democrats must "Listen
more intently and engage those who confront them" with the very ideas that they
espoused in the first place to get into office. Lamm wants to save democracy by
electing another lying politician to run the country further into the ground.

A petty reaction to Bush's attendance at memorial

Re: "Bush's awkward reaction draws reaction online," July 14 news story.

I'm no fan of George W. Bush, but it was sad to hear that some people watching
the memorial for the slain Dallas police officers focused on the color of his
suit and his singing and joining hands at the end. Following President Obama's
plea to open our hearts, as well as Bush himself giving a fine speech, the
Twitter comments were petty, mean and against the spirit of the gathering.

Job well done to University of Denver athletic program

Re: "DU most successful program among non football schools," July 14 sports
story.

I read with great interest the continued success that University of Denver
sports has had under the leadership of DU athletic director Peg Bradley Doppes.
As a mega fan of DU athletics, it looks to me like the coaches, the staff and
the athletes have created a very successful roadmap for future national
championships. Kudos and a tip of the DU cap for the university's competitive
program both in the classroom, where it counts, and on the floor, the ice and
the ground. Job well done. Go Pios.

Despite extreme drought, fewer wildfires in the Valley this year

BYLINE: Jared Taylor, The Monitor, McAllen, Texas

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 546 words


Aug. 20--Tony Pena checks the National Weather Service's forecast for potential
wildfires every day.

"It says today will be a bad day for erratic wildfire behavior," Pena said. "The
ingredients are all still there."

But the wildfires have not followed.

After an unprecedented wildfire season in 2008, the Hidalgo County fire marshal
said 2009 has been a relatively quiet year, especially for an area wracked by
extreme drought.

Pena and others have no explanation for the calm but point to widespread
coverage of wildfires by local media outlets and a burn ban in Hidalgo County
that extends into mid-October.

"The attention that the media has given us has been a good thing," Edinburg Fire
Chief Shawn Snider said. "It's brought some awareness across the (Rio Grande)
Valley."

But they're not questioning their luck too much.

"We've had our share of fires -- don't get me wrong," Palmview Fire Chief Jerry
Alaniz said. "But not as bad as last year."

Many of this year's grass fires have been started by power lines that snap on
windy days -- not by residents burning trash outdoors, as was the case in years
past, Alaniz said.

More than 41,000 acres burned in 11 major wildfires across Hidalgo, Starr and
the southern halves of Jim Hogg and Brooks counties last year, according to
records of major wildfires kept by the U.S. Department of Interior.

There have been eight such fires in the region so far this year, but they burned
only 13,306 acres.

"There still are fires -- it's just not as many here recently," Snider said.

Hidalgo County statistics show more than 84,000 acres burned from all wildfires
during the 2008 wildfire season, which ended in July when Hurricane Dolly's
rains flooded much of the area. Figures for 2009 were not immediately available,
but Pena said he expects "the numbers are going to be down."

Rainfall has been virtually nonexistent in the region this summer, with just
5.45 inches recorded at McAllen-Miller International Airport so far in 2009.
That's more than 7 inches below average.

The last measurable rainfall in McAllen -- just 0.06 inches -- came July 11,
according to the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Brownsville.

The fire danger could last well into September -- traditionally the Valley's
wettest month.

"Some years, you may have a lot of rainfall in September -- some, you may not,"
said Buddy Martin, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Brownsville.
"We're in a drought, so that may not necessarily happen."

Despite the quiet wildfire season, Edinburg's Fire Chief Snider said extra
manpower and equipment remain on call -- a grass fire could spark any time.

"The conditions have not changed," he said. "The wind is blowing. The fuel is
here. It's dry. All the conditions for a major wildfire are here."

Scientists, land managers debate how to adapt to wildfires

BYLINE: Staci Matlock, The Santa Fe New Mexican

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 797 words


Feb. 27--Big fires are as certain as taxes in the Southwest, fueled lately by
drought, overgrown forests and climate change.

Wildfires are burning hundreds of thousands of acres, changing landscapes,
destroying homes and costing more than a billion dollars a year. Preparing teams
to fight them and repairing burned land to reduce flooding after a wildfire
costs millions more.

Last year, one wildfire also cost the lives of 19 Arizona firefighters.

The mounting challenges brought more than 150 scientists and land managers
together in Tucson, Ariz., this week to brainstorm the best strategies to help
Southwestern ecosystems and communities adapt to wildfire.

"This requires re-envisioning our relationship to fire," said Timothy Ingalsbee,
co-director of the Association for Fire Ecology in Eugene, Ore.

Communities need to learn to live with fire, said Ingalsbee, one of the
conference organizers. "Massive siege-like suppression spectacles that try to
contain and control wildfires when conditions make them humanly impossible to
stop are hugely expensive to taxpayers, damage the land and put firefighters at
unnecessary extra risk," he said.

While drought and fire have been a normal part of Southwestern ecosystems for
centuries, climate change is contributing to larger wildfires and conditions
affecting huge swaths of landscape.

"The new fundamental question is, can ecosystems remain intact in light of
future climate change?" said Don Falk, associate professor at the Institute for
the Environment at the University of Arizona. Landscape-scale changes, where
wildfires burn 250,000 acres or more, threaten water supplies, wildlife habitat
and economic development, he said.

The rate of the changes and the probability of more change ahead in the
Southwest as average temperatures increase is raising questions about how land
managers should restore forests after a fire. "Do we try to keep things the way
they were before climate change, and how practical is that?" Falk said.

Using fire to fight fires is a big topic of conversation at the conference,
Ingalsbee said. New Mexico has for years used prescribed fires to reduce the
severity of unplanned wildfires.

Prescribed fires used on a regular basis thin out trees and other flammable
vegetation, restore overgrown forests to a healthy state and even enrich the
soil. Frequent smaller fires managed by fire crews mimic the natural fire cycle
that once existed in some forest types, such as ponderosa pine.

The cycle was broken from the late 1800s to the late 1900s as fire suppression,
logging and livestock grazing changed the landscape. Southwestern forests grew
dense with vegetation and ripe for massive wildfires.

Over the long run, thinning and prescribed fires to reduce the scale and scope
of wildfires is a more cost-effective use of taxpayer money than spending it to
fight and clean up after a massive conflagration, said participants at the fire
ecology conference. Falk said there's about a 10-to-1 savings in the costs of
treating forests compared to the costs of fighting wildfires. "We know that when
you send out air tankers and Type I crews, you are spending millions of dollars
per week," he said.

Firefighting costs alone have averaged more than $1.5 billion a year since 2008,
according to a study by Headwaters Economics, an independent research group.
That doesn't include the costs of replacing homes or addressing flood damage
caused by heavy rains on fire-stripped soils.

Communities have no say over how fires are fought, but they have plenty to say
about how they prepare for wildfire, said Alexander Evans, research director for
the Forest Guild in Santa Fe.

A prepared community would have houses constructed to withstand fire and have
properties free of thick vegetation and weeds that fuel wildfires. "There's a
long way to go to get to that golden ideal," Evans said.

Communities in high fire risk areas, in the meantime, can follow Ready, Set, Go,
an International Association of Fire Chiefs program that seeks to improve
dialogue between firefighters and residents, Evans said. The program teaches
people to prepare the items such as clothes, medicine and valuables they would
want to take in case a wildfire forces an evacuation, as well as a plan for
where to go and how to stay in touch with family.

Emergency team prepares for summer fires

LENGTH: 322 words



HIGHLIGHT: A GROUP launched to tackle the threat of wildfires is stepping up the
fight against countryside blazes.


The Cumbria Wildfire Group, formed by various partners including Cumbria County
Council, Cumbria Fire & Rescue Service, the Lake District National Park
Authority and the Forestry Commission, has been in operation for just over a
year.

Now summer is here - the peak time for wildfires - the group is highlighting the
training and advice it offers to its members including landowners, land managers
and mountain rescue teams to minimise the risk of fires, and new members are
being urged to come forward and get involved.

With global warming and greater use of the countryside for recreational
activities, the threat of wildfires continues to increase.

Over the past decade the number of wildfires in Cumbria has doubled.

So to counteract this threat, training has become a key element of the group's
activities, with the Basic Wildfire Fighting course covering the principles of
fire behaviour, fire fighting techniques, health and safety and a section by the
Fire and Rescue Service on its operating procedures. A standard fire plan has
also been distributed to group members to allow for a more effective response by
land managers and the Fire and Rescue Service to wildfires on all land.

The group's project officer, Ethan Bigelow, said: "Cumbria Wildfire Group is
engaged in vital work to protect the county from potentially disastrous
wildfires.

"Through educating and informing our members we are reducing the risk of blazes
breaking out and teaching people about tackling them as quickly and effectively
as possible if they do occur.

"Our work is especially important during the summer months when hot, dry weather
increases the chance of fires, so we'd be keen to hear from new members who want
to get involved." The battle against wildfires has also been boosted by a fleet
of eight specially modified Land Rovers now with  Cumbria Fire and Rescue
Service.

Clendaniel: How California and Western states should shift their fire prevention
strategy

BYLINE: Ed Clendaniel

LENGTH: 883 words



HIGHLIGHT: The latest Southern California wildfires, which have destroyed 790
structures, burned 175,000 acres and displaced 90,000 from their homes,  demand
a major shift in fire prevention strategy


When the phone rang at 4:50 a.m. Thursday, I woke up on high alert. No one calls
that early with good news.

When I saw the caller ID said CSUN Emergency, my heart started racing. My
youngest son, Cameron, attends California State University-Northridge. High
alert shifted to dread.

It turned out the call was just to inform us that CSUN was canceling classes
that day due to poor air quality and transportation issues stemming from the
massive Southern California wildfires. What a relief. But there was no chance I
would go back to sleep without finding out how close the fires were to CSUNs
dorms and what the strategy was for putting the fires out.

The latter was of particular interest because Ive been writing and editing
stories and editorials on California wildfires ever since the 1991 Oakland Hills
fire, which killed 25 people, destroyed more than 3,000 homes and resulted in
$1.5 billion worth of damage.

A quarter century later, neither the state nor the federal government has
figured out an effective way to combat these wildfires.

The Southern California fires hit just two months after the massive devastation
caused by the Wine Country fires. They have destroyed 790 structures, burned
175,000 acres and displaced 90,000 from their homes. This demands a major shift
in strategy.

My brother Bob concurs. He is the fire chief of Walla Walla Countys rural Fire
District No. 8 in the state of Washington. He texted me Friday to tell me his
crew was next on a shortlist to head south and help fight the Southern
California fires. One strike team of fire engines from Walla Walla and the
nearby Tri-Cities had already left that morning.

I knew thats what firefighters throughout the West routinely do whenever another
region needs help. But it raised my interest in Californias strategic thinking
to an even higher level.

As proud as I am of my brothers efforts over the years to save lives and homes,
I know how dangerous it is. About 80 firefighters have lost their lives fighting
fires in the United States this year.

As the impact of climate change continues to grow, California and other states
need to put considerably more resources into both preventing wildfires and, when
they do start, reducing their impact.

We need not accept Gov. Jerry Browns warning Saturday that the firestorms in
Southern California are the new normal. The state Legislature, Congress and
local governments must find the political will to make fire prevention a higher
priority.

The alternative is to accept an increase in the number of wildfires that go out
of control and jump into urban, residential areas, causing billions of dollars
of damage in California and throughout the West.

For starters, California and the federal government need to stop robbing their
fire prevention budgets to pay the increasing costs of fighting fires.

Eight years ago the federal Department of Interior and Department of Agriculture
submitted the FLAME Act (Federal Land Assistance, Management and Enhancement), a
comprehensive wildfire strategy crafted in collaboration with state and local
governments. A special emphasis was placed on reducing the severe challenges of
wildfire on areas of high-risk. Its a major problem for Western states.

It set three specific goals:

Establish enough reserves for the Forest Service and Interior Department to
effectively prevent and extinguish wildfires.

Manage vegetation and increase the use of controlled burns to improve the
resiliency of forests and range lands.

Engage homeowners and communities in being more proactive to reduce both the
risk of fires and the impact when they occur.

The funding has not been forthcoming, primarily because members of Congress,
heavily influenced by either environmentalists or the logging industry, cannot
agree on proper forest management techniques. Instead, President Trump wants to
cut $300 million from the Forest Services firefighting budget and $50 million
from the wildfire prevention budget.

Im well aware of the presidents desire to shrink government, but this is
outrageous.

Insurance claims for Northern California wildfires reach $9B      The Wine
Country fires caused an estimated $3 billion in damage. The Southern California
fires are estimated at $1 billion so far.

And thats not counting the costs of fighting the fires. Every dollar invested in
fire prevention now would save hundreds of dollars in potential damage from
wildfires in 2018.

Im relieved that the Southern California fires remain far enough away from my
sons dorm that they dont pose a threat. And my brother and his crew havent yet
been called on to head south. But 2018 will bring more dry conditions and high
winds that will make Western states vulnerable to even greater devastation.

Firefighters and property owners in rural areas need to demand sufficient
funding to make California as safe as possible from wildfires.

Association (NFPA) on Wednesday, August 19, 2015 at 2:00 pm EDT to help
builders, remodelers, architects and consumers make better choices in design and
materials that are environmentally sound, and safer from wildfire.

The webinar, "Building Safer in Natural Areas - Firewise and Wildland Fire,"
will be hosted by Michele Steinberg, NFPA's Wildland Fire Operations Division
Manager, who will discuss concepts and techniques around siting, designing,
building and maintaining homes and neighborhoods to resist ignition from
wildland fire. She will also explain how Firewise techniques can help reduce
exposure to wildfire threat.

Increasing public awareness about wildfire safety, enhancing fire-related codes
and policies, developing effective risk mitigation strategies, and creating
comprehensive Community Wildfire Protection Plans (CWPP) is essential. Land
owners, communities and businesses that are already in wildfire-prone areas need
to continue to invest in fireproofing measures, and municipalities will have to
plan on assuming firefighting costs and making better--and sometimes
difficult--planning and zoning decisions in high risk areas to create safer
places to live for residents.

"Research has shown that well-built homes and well-designed landscapes are much
more likely to survive a wildfire," said Steinberg. "The building and design
community has a lot to offer to help solve the challenge of home destruction in
a wildfire. NFPA is pleased to present this webinar and work closely with Green
Builder Media and its audience to raise awareness and continue the dialogue
about the importance of wildfire safety and mitigation in communities."

The U.S. Forest Service has confirmed that wildfire seasons are increasing in
length and intensity. A recent study published in Nature Communications
indicates that there is "a significant lengthening of fire weather seasons
across 25.3 percent of the planet's vegetated lands, leading to the elevation of
mean fire season duration by up to 18.7 percent." The study also states that,
"the locations, which have become prone to burning due to the long periods of
fire weather, also increased by 108.1 percent."

The Firewise Communities Program encourages local solutions for safety by
involving homeowners in taking individual responsibility for preparing their
homes from the risk of wildfire. The program is co-sponsored by the USDA Forest
Service, the US Department of the Interior, and the National Association of
State Foresters.

Wildfires keeping firefighters busy

BYLINE: Jessica Mccarthy, The News Herald, Panama City, Fla.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 682 words


Aug. 26--PANAMA CITY -- Six separate wildfires in four Panhandle counties have
kept the Florida Forest Service busy over the last several days, and fire
officials warn the area is still drier than normal.

In Bay County, the "Timbercrest" wildfire has burned about 40 acres in the
Fountain area in the vicinity of Timbercrest Road and Burnout Road. Brian
Goddin, wildfire mitigation specialist, said fire officials believe the fire was
started by lightning.

He also said the department has the fire 100 percent contained, which means a
clear fireline has been established around the area. This does not mean the fire
is totally out, though, and he encouraged people to remain cautious when burning
anything or using items that can cause sparks.

Also in Bay County, forestry crews are continuing to "mop up" the 3-acre "Vick
Road" wildfire just east of the Gulf Power power plant off County 2300. The
Forest Service reported no homes or other structures are considered threatened
at this time.

Recent rainfall has lessened some drought conditions, but the surface moisture
is drying out and wildlands landscape can still carry fire.

"People still need to be cautious; they can't get complacent yet," Goddin said.

Jeff Fournier, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the
Panhandle still has a severe drought rating on the long-term drought scale. Bay
County is rated a 2 on the short-term drought scale, which means the county is
not in extreme fire danger, but there is still cause for concern, he said. These
two ratings indicate rainfall is still below average over a large portion of
Northwest Florida, but it's unknown just how much rain is needed to change that.

"It's hard to say for sure because different areas need a certain type of rain,"
Fournier said. "Having heavy rainfall in a short time is not so good because it
runs off."

As of 3 p.m. Friday, so far this year, the Panama City area has officially
recorded 33.79 inches of rain, compared to a normal total of 47.23 inches by
this point in the year, according to EJS Weather, a national weather forecasting
service. Because of the nature of Florida's popcorn-like thunderstorms, some
areas have seen more rain than the official total, and some have received much
less.

As for the other active wildfires in the region:

-In Calhoun County, the "Highway 20" wildfire was reported Monday and is
believed to have been started by a lightning strike. It has been contained at
only 2 acres.

-The "Gasline" Wildfire in Holmes County between Ponce de Leon and Argyle just
south of U.S. 90 is controlled at about 50 acres. It has been determined it was
started by heat from railroad activity. This fire is near the Holmes
County/Walton County line.

-Also in Holmes County, the 20-acre "Baker Pond" wildfire is believed to have
been started by lightning and was reported Tuesday.  It has been contained off
County179-A.

-The "Chance Bay" wildfire between Chipley and Bonifay is contained at 8 acres.
Firefighters suspect it was started by lightning late Monday evening.

Fire tips

The Forest Service offers safety tips for people to consider during the drought:

-Take some time to clean up your yard and clean your roof and gutters of debris
that can serve as "fuel" to airborne embers from a wildfire so that you don''t
"invite" a wildfire to your home.

-Remove leaves, pine needles, twigs and palm fronds, etc., from roofs and
gutters.

-Clear burnable materials like wood piles and dead plants from the sides of the
home.

-Clean, mow and water the area surrounding the home (up to 30 feet) to prevent
leading wildfires from the woods to your door.

-Be careful when using fire for anything, including campfires and barbecues.
Make sure someone watches the fire at all times until it is out. Never leave any
fire unattended.

-Use caution when using anything that can cause a spark.

-Supervise children and be sure they understand the dangers of fire and the
possible consequences of their actions.

Wildfires causing air quality issues in southern B.C

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A5

LENGTH: 415 words

DATELINE: KAMLOOPS


Wildfires burning in British Columbia's Interior are resulting in poor air
quality for much of the southern half of the province.

Environment Canada issued an air quality advisory for much of southern B.C.,
from Metro Vancouver east toward Elk Valley and as far north as Prince George.

It warns people with respiratory conditions, infants and the elderly should stay
indoors in a place that's cool and ventilated.

Metro Vancouver is also warning that in addition to the smoky air caused by
wildfires in the U.S., ground-level ozone is also expected to reach advisory
levels for parts of the region and Fraser Valley.

Regional officials are warning people to avoid strenuous activities outside,
especially in the midafternoon and early evening when ozone levels are at the
highest.

Although the wildfire season appears to be far from over, more residents who
were forced out of their homes due to a blaze east of Kelowna last week are now
allowed to return.

The Central Okanagan Emergency Operations Centre said Tuesday an evacuation
order affecting nearly 200 people has been replaced with an alert, meaning
residents can go home but must still be ready to leave at a moment's notice.

The blaze that reached about 465 hectares in size forced out 1,000 people, but
by Sunday about 600 were able to return.

The BC Wildfire Service said a blaze that was sparked 20 kilometres east of
Kelowna on Thursday is now 20 per cent contained.

Wildlife experts are warning of the long-term consequences of the historic
wildfire season that could make bears more troublesome as they fatten up before
hibernation.

Wildsafe B.C. provincial co-ordinator Frank Ritcey said there is always
increased conflict between bears and humans in autumn, as the bruins search for
food.

He predicts this fall will be particularly challenging because huge swaths of
the province have been charred by wildfires, killing the berries and grasses
bears rely on.

Residents with gardens and fruit trees are advised to harvest early and often,
while garbage cans should be kept secured and indoors until just before pickup.

The warning comes as BC Wildfire Service spokesman Kevin Skrepnek predicts the
province's wildfire season could stretch into the fall because continued hot,
dry weather is forecast over southern B.C.

He said the province has spent $404 million fighting fires that have scorched
10,600 square kilometres of timber, bush and grassland since April 1, the
greatest area the province has lost to wildfires in a single season.

Washington: Cantwell, Gardner Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Modernize
Firefighting Technology

LENGTH: 725  words



Washington, DC: U.S. Senate Committee on Energy & Resources has issued the
following press release:
Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), ranking member of the Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee and Senator Cory Gardner (R-Colo.)
introduced the Wildfire Management Technology Advancement Act of 2017, a bill
designed to bring firefighting agencies into the 21st century.


This bill will increase firefighter safety by requiring the Forest Service and
the Department of the Interior to begin providing GPS locations for crews on
wildfires and to begin using Unmanned Aircraft Systems to scout out and map
wildfires in real-time.  Wildfire Today refers to the simultaneous use of
mapping aircraft and GPS locators as the 'Holy Grail' of firefighter safety.
"Firefighters on the front lines and those who give their lives to protect us
deserve fair treatment from their government," Senator Cantwell said. "My
legislation would combine these two technologies [real-time fire mapping and GPS
locating] to give our firefighters more safety and security as they deal with
these unbelievable conditions."
In addition to the use of advanced technology, the Wildfire Management
Technology Advancement Act of 2017 requires that trends in firefighter injuries
be analyzed in order to target training to prevent future injuries and
fatalities.
Communities and businesses would also benefit from provisions in the Wildfire
Management Technology Advancement Act of 2017. This bill directs the Agencies to
work with NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab and the Department of the Interior's
National Labs, e.g., the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, to better
predict the areas that will most likely experience large wildfires during fire
season. These forecasts will allow for agencies to more strategically stage
resources before fires occur. In addition, this legislation requires smoke
forecasters be assigned to all large wildfires to provide the most accurate
information to those impacted by a wildfire.
Finally, this bill includes provisions to streamline firefighting response.
Cost-share funding is authorized for at-risk communities to install and operate
next-generation reverse-911 systems, potentially speeding up evacuations and
saving lives. This legislation also authorizes disaster agencies to make use of
NASA's tools to speed-up the installation of post-fire, erosion-prevention
measures.
The Wildfire Management Technology Advancement Act of 2017 has received support
from national firefighter organizations:
"Wildland firefighters need the support of Congress to get federal agencies to
utilize the best available science and most advanced technology in federal fire
management. The past two decades have seen millions of tax dollars invested in
research and development of high-tech tools that can accurately map, monitor,
and model wildfire spread. Senator Cantwell's proposed legislation will enable
us to reap the benefits of those investments to improve the safety and success
of crews managing wildfires," said Timothy Ingalsbee, executive director of
Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics, and Ecology.
"Wildfires are having an increasing impact on public and firefighter safety,"
said Lorraine Carli, Vice President of Outreach and Advocacy for the National
Fire Protection Association (NFPA). "Legislative support for technologies that
streamline firefighting response and improve safety conditions for first
responders and residents alike is critical as this threat grows. This bill will
help get key scientific research and knowledge applied where it will make a
significant difference."
Senator Cantwell has worked for years to pass bipartisan wildfire legislation.
In 2015, she visited Washington State, holding a series of roundtables and
listening sessions on best practices to fight wildfires, as well as a field
hearing on the topic. The legislation being introduced today incorporates ideas
Senator Cantwell heard during those sessions.
"Firefighters on the front lines and those who give their lives to protect us
deserve fair treatment from their government," said Senator Cantwell during a
March 2017 hearing when she announced she was working with Senator Cory Gardner
on bipartisan legislation to give firefighters access to state-of-the-art
technology to assist in firefighting around the country.

Wildfire earn first point against Turbos

SECTION: Pg. 01

LENGTH: 251  words

DATELINE: ARTICLE


For the first time in the nearly six-year history of the National Ringette
League, the Waterloo Wildfire have something to show after a pair of weekend
games with their Waterloo Region rivals, the Cambridge Turbos.

Saturday night at RIM Park in Waterloo the Wildfire took a one-goal lead three
different times before Cambridge, the defending NRL champs, tied it up 3-3 with
82 seconds remaining in the contest.

The Wildfire earned their first ever point against Cambridge, who are the
standard bearers for the ringette league, and took them to the fourth round of
the shootout before losing 4-3.

Christina Mascherin of Cambridge was named the game's first star, scoring both
of her team's goals in the shootout and once in regulation time.

Lisa Malanka in the Wildfire cage stopped 28 of 31 Cambridge shots and earned
the second star.

Wildfire co-captain, Amanda Somerville, the game's third star, scored once and
assisted on the other two Wildfire markers while also scoring Waterloo's only
goal in the shootout. Lindsey Vivian and Bryanna Kelly also scored for the
Wildfire.

Sunday afternoon in Cambridge the plot was different. The Turbos took the early
lead and trailed 3-2 at the half. Cambridge increased the lead to 5-2 in the
first nine minutes of the second half.

This time, however, unlike many times in the past, the Wildfire did not collapse
but instead dominated the final 11 minutes and came within a goal with under
seven minutes remaining.

The Wildfire had to settle for a moral victory in the 5-4 loss.

Kamloops Fire Centre updates Elephant Hill wildfire restrictions on Crown land

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 473 words


The Kamloops Fire Centre updated restrictions for all Crown land in the vicinity
of the Elephant Hill wildfire Sunday. The restrictions will remain in force
until noon on Oct. 31 or until the order is rescinded.

The Elephant Hill fire restrictions reach the Horse Lake Road and include
Sheridan Lake and Green Lake entirely.

As the Elephant Hill wildfire continues to be active with ongoing fire
suppression efforts, the BC Wildfire Service asks the public to abide by the
order so that fire suppression operations are not impeded and can be done safely
and effectively, said Noelle Kekula, Kamloops Fire Centre information officer.

There are ongoing patrols by the RCMP and B.C. Conservation Officer Service
within the restricted area to ensure that the public remains clear of this area
for their safety as well as crews continuing with their suppression efforts.

"Public and fire personnel safety remains the number one priority of the BC
Wildfire Service," Kekula said.

The order applies to all Crown land within the geographic boundaries as outlined
on the map which is available online at: http://ow.ly/qhPM30eSPFF

Area restrictions are put in place to help protect public safety and allow fire
suppression efforts to continue efficiently. Under this order and Section 11(2)
of the Wildfire Act, a person must not remain in or enter the Elephant Hill
wildfire restricted area without prior written authorization of an official
designated for the purposes of the Wildfire Act, unless the person:

Enters the area only in the course of:

1. travelling to or from his or her principle residence that is not under an
evacuation order;

2. travelling to or from leased property for the purpose of accessing a
secondary residence or recreational property not under an evacuation order;

3. using a highway as defined in the Transportation Act;

4. travelling as a person acting in an official capacity;

5. travelling for the purpose of supporting wildfire suppression activities;

6. engaging and/or participating in a commercial activity within the regular
course of the person's business or employment on private or leased lands; and

Warning as weather creates conditions for wildfires

LENGTH: 392  words


The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) is appealing to everyone in the
countryside to pay close attention to wildfire danger warnings as weather
forecasters predict dry and windy conditions in the coming days.

A high pressure system is dominating the UK's weather and this has historically
been linked to elevated wildfire behaviour at this time of year.

While no specific wildfire warnings are in place forecasters have advised that
the situation, which has the potential to bring dry continental air to Scotland,
is likely to persist for the coming week.

Andy Coueslant, SFRS Deputy Assistant Chief Officer and chairman of the Scottish
Wildfire Forum, said raising awareness is key to reducing the risk.

He explained: "Wildfire conditions have the potential to change markedly from
day-to-day depending on the wind direction and it's all-the-more important
people are vigilant and act responsibly while this period of high pressure
affects the country.

"Many rural and remote communities are hugely impacted by wildfires, which can
cause significant environmental and economic damage.

"Livestock, farmland, wildlife, protected woodland and sites of special
scientific interest can all be devastated by these fires, as can the lives of
people living and working in rural communities.

"Human behaviour can significantly lower the chance of a wildfire starting and
also help us to bring those that do happen under control, so it's crucial people
act safely and responsibly in rural environments and follow the countryside
code."

The public can help prevent wildfires by making sure they dispose of litter and
smoking materials carefully while in rural areas.

There are a number of things land managers can do to help prevent wildfires,
including strict adherence to the Muirburn Code, which applies to the controlled
burning of heather within the permitted season.

Further advice is available on the Your Safety section of the SFRS website,
www.firescotland.gov.uk, where links can be found to both the Muirburn Code and
the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.

Many wildfires are started deliberately or are due to careless, reckless or
irresponsible behaviour.

Anyone who sees someone acting suspiciously, recklessly or irresponsibly in the
countryside should contact Police Scotland on 101 or pass information
anonymously to Scotland Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

A high pressure system is dominating the UK's weather and this has historically
been linked to elevated wildfire behaviour at this time of year.

While no specific wildfire warnings are in place forecasters have advised that
the situation, which has the potential to bring dry continental air to Scotland,
is likely to persist for the coming week.

Andy Coueslant, SFRS Deputy Assistant Chief Officer and chairman of the Scottish
Wildfire Forum, said raising awareness is key to reducing the risk.

He explained: "Wildfire conditions have the potential to change markedly from

people are vigilant and act responsibly while this period of high pressure
affects the country.

"Many rural and remote communities are hugely impacted by wildfires, which can
cause significant environmental and economic damage.

"Livestock, farmland, wildlife, protected woodland and sites of special
scientific interest can all be devastated by these fires, as can the lives of

"Human behaviour can significantly lower the chance of a wildfire starting and
also help us to bring those that do happen under control, so it's crucial people
act safely and responsibly in rural environments and follow the countryside
code."

The public can help prevent wildfires by making sure they dispose of litter and
smoking materials carefully while in rural areas.

There are a number of things land managers can do to help prevent wildfires,
including strict adherence to the Muirburn Code, which applies to the controlled
burning of heather within the permitted season.

Wildfires continue to ravage

LENGTH: 268  words

DATELINE: KATHMANDU


KATHMANDU, April 5 -- Inferno has hit various parts of the country, causing
destruction of forestland and vegetation.

Some wildfires have been raging for several days and even weeks, but the
measures to control the blaze have so far been futile due to windy weather.

Wildfires have wreaked havoc in most of the 395 community forests in Dhankuta
district. The blaze has already destroyed around 800 hectares forestland.

Krishna Rai from the Federation of Community Forestry Users said timber and
herbs worth millions of rupees have been destroyed.

Wildfires that broke out in the forests of Udayapur district two weeks ago have
not come under control.

More than 20 forests at Mahabharat and Chure forest range have been hit by
wildfire. District Forest Office has mobilised a large number of people to
contain the conflagration, but to no avail.

The office informed wildfires ravaged forests at Triyuga Municipality and
Hadiya, Jogidaha, Beltar, Sundapur, Rampurthoksila, Tapeshwori, Chaudandi,
Risku, Tribeni and Saune VDCs.

Meanwhile, people living close to wildfire-affected regions of the district are
suffering from respiratory problems, which health officials ascribe to
inhalation of smoke produced by wildfire.

In Parbat, a wildfire that started at Panchase region on Saturday, is yet to
come under control. Security personnel and locals had briefly contained the fire
on Sunday. More than 700 hectares of forestland have already been destroyed.

Wine country wildfires torch California homes

BYLINE: By ELLEN KNICKMEYER Associated Press

SECTION: NATION_; Pg. 0

LENGTH: 807 words


SONOMA, Calif. -- Wildfires whipped by powerful winds swept through Northern
California early Monday, sending residents on a headlong flight to safety
through smoke and flames as homes and businesses burned in wine country. Gov.
Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in Napa, Sonoma and Yuba counties as
officials estimated the fire had wiped out "well in excess of" 50 structures.

Brown said in his statement that the multiple fires "threatened thousands of
homes." Mandatory evacuations were ordered in the wine country north of San
Francisco Bay and elsewhere after blazes broke out late Sunday, sending many
into a middle-of-the-night scramble to get out. There were long lines at gas
stations as many received the call to evacuate. "It was an inferno like you've
never seen before," said Marian Williams, who caravanned with neighbors through
flames before dawn as one of the wildfires reached the vineyards and ridges at
her small Sonoma County town of Kenwood. Williams could feel the heat of her
fire through the car as she fled. "Trees were on fire like torches," she said.
With so many fires, residents of Sonoma County struggled to figure out what
roads to take, finding downed trees or flames blocking some routes. Fires also
burned just to the east in the Napa County wine country as well as in Yuba,
Butte and Nevada counties -- all north of the state capital. Cal Fire tweeted
that as many as 8,000 homes were threatened in Nevada County, which lies on the
western slope of the Sierra Nevada. Napa County Fire Chief Barry Biermann said
more than 50 structures had been destroyed, but there were no reports of
injuries or deaths. Biermann said the fires had burned more than 68 square miles
(176 sq. kilometers) as of the morning. He said crews had no containment on the
quick-moving fire. "Right now with these conditions we can't get ahead of this
fire and do anything about the forward progress," Biermann said. Smoke was thick
in San Francisco, 60 miles (96 kilometers) south of the Sonoma County fire.
Sonoma County resident John Dean was driving home early Monday when "I looked
over and saw a house on fire" along the road. Soon he saw more houses engulfed
in flames. "I mean blazing, falling down on fire," he said. Dean sped to his
Kenwood home, alerted neighbors, and fled to the town of Sonoma. He was one of
hundreds of evacuees who streamed into a 24-hour Safeway market overnight, while
authorities set up an official evacuation center. Maureen McGowan was
house-sitting for a brother near Kenwood, and said both of the homes on his
property were on fire when she left. At the Safeway, she pointed to her feet,
still in slippers. She had fled so fast that she hadn't put on her shoes. Belia
Ramos, chairwoman of the Napa County Board of Supervisors, said officials did
not yet have a count on how many properties were affected, either by the fire
directly or by evacuations. "We're focusing on making evacuations and trying to
keep people safe. We are not prepared to start counting. Certainly with day just
breaking now, we are starting to see the structures that are affected," she said
shortly after sunrise. "The gusts are very, very -- they're tremendous and it's
what makes this fire unpredictable. It's something that we're having to be very
cautious about," she said. Ann Dubay, a spokeswoman for Sonoma County Emergency
Operations Center, said the area where the largest fire started was relatively
rural "but it went through many, many neighborhoods and we're sure that
structures have burned, we don't know how many we don't have a count yet."
"Probably many homes and businesses, in the outskirts of Santa Rosa and the city
itself," she said. "It's a huge, huge tragedy, a huge, huge loss for so many
people." Emergency lines were inundated with callers reporting smoke in the
area, prompting officials to ask that the public "only use 911 if they see
actual unattended flames, or are having another emergency." Business owner Andy
Lahiji stood before a burned out storage warehouse where he said he had lost his
inventory of furniture and other property. He said it took firetrucks ages to
arrive Monday morning. "They said we have so many other places to go, you have
to wait. And then when they came, they had only a couple of guys," he told the
station. "I really, I feel very sad. I'm glad nobody got hurt. Hopefully
insurance takes care of it." The National Weather Service said widespread wind
gusts between 35 mph and 50 mph were observed in the north San Francisco Bay
region and isolated spots hit 70 mph. The winds were expected to subside at
midday. Community centers, the Sonoma County Fairgrounds and other local centers
were opened for evacuees. Associated Press writers Juliet Williams in San
Francisco, John Antczak in Los Angeles and Martha Bellisle in Seattle
contributed to this report.

PA fire dept. awaits wildfire duties

BYLINE: Eric Plummer, Alberni Valley Times

SECTION: REGION; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 677 words


The province's resources to control wildfires are wearing thin, prompting local
governments to look to their fire departments to provide additional support.

Last week city council approved a recommendation from the Port Alberni Fire
Department to make the municipal firefighters available for forest incidents if
the provincial personnel need help. Last year the local fire department was put
on standby as incidents in other parts of the province drew wildfire fighters
away from the Valley. The department's availability brought the city revenue
through a contract with the province. With forest fires continuing to emerge on
Vancouver Island and throughout B.C., Port Alberni's fire chief Tim Pley is
anticipating a call for help from the province this summer.

"Wildfire activity in the province has already reached near-record levels. B.C.
Wildfire service resources are being deployed away from Vancouver Island to
fight active fires," he wrote in a recent report for council. "With depleting
staff resources on Vancouver Island, B.C. wildfire service may turn to local
government fire departments for firefighting support." The role of the
Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District's fire departments has already been expanded
to wildfire suppression if situations arise - especially for the Sproat Lake
Volunteer Fire Department, who monitored the area as the Dog Mountain situation
continued to burn this month.

On Friday the Wildfire Management Branch reported that Dog Mountain is being
patrolled around the clock.

Although the fire is contained, the public is asked to stay away from the area
due to unstable slopes and precariously unburnt sections of the forest.

"Crews have indicated that rocks, trees and other debris has fallen down the
steep slope and urge everyone to continue to steer clear of the area. The
shoreline is not safe under this fire," stated the wildfire branch. "Several
phone reports have come into the fire centre over the last few days reporting
smoke and open flame on Dog Mountain. This is an active fire and it is expected
that there will be open flame and smoke within the perimeter of this fire as it
continues to consume forest fuels." The number of forest fires discovered across
the province had reached 1,115 by Thursday - more than double the total
incidents reported by mid July in 2014.

"At this time of year it is fairly common for us to see more lighting-caused
fires than humancaused fire," said Navi Sani, a fire information officer with
the Wildfire Management Branch. "We have seen an abnormally high level of
lightning activity fairly early in the season."

So far over 293,000 hectares have burned, a total approaching the 369,169
hectares affected over all of last year, which was the most British Columbia has
seen in over a decade. The province has reported spending $119.6 million on
suppression efforts so far in 2015.

More than 780 contracted personnel are currently fighting wildfires, part of
2,500 workers involved in suppression efforts in different capacities across the
province. Almost 150 wildfire fighters have been brought in from out of B.C.,
including 53 experts who arrived last week from Australia to help manage the
situation.

"They will be deployed across the province based on current and anticipated
wildfire activity," said Saini of the Australian support. "All of our available
crews are engaged in fire efforts across the province, either actively engaged,
taking mandatory days of rest, or on standby."

Three states of emergency are in place for the Cariboo and Squamish-Lillooet
regional districts, as well as the ACRD for the Dog Mountain blaze. An
evacuation order remains on Dog Mountain, where one unoccupied cabin was lost,
reported the province.

While 2015 is shaping up to be a record year for forest fires, Saini noted that
some headway was made last week in controlling new incidents.

"This number does seem to be decreasing over the past few days as we make good
progress on existing fires and the new fires that we respond to are contained,"
she said.

Wildfires Burn Budgets

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. A6

LENGTH: 603 words


When it comes to wildfires, an old axiom applies: We can pay for them now or
pay for them later. What isn't included in that saw, however, is the idea that
paying for wildfires later will greatly increase the price.Because of that,
good forest management and strong fire prevention should be considered an
investment. Yes, they can be costly - but not as costly as the alternative. As
Peter Goldmark, state commissioner of public lands, said last week in a meeting
with The Columbian's editorial board: "An investment now can help reduce a huge
cost.

Once the fires get big, they become enormously expensive."Goldmark was making a
case for increased funding for his department, which - among other duties -
oversees a firefighting force that helps defend roughly 13 million acres of
public and private land. And his case is a strong one. While the 2015-17
biennial budget proposed in the House of Representatives earmarks $47 million
in fire-suppression funding for Goldmark's agency, the cost of fighting
wildfires last year was nearly twice that amount.The fear is that costs will
continue to grow. Last year included the Carlton Complex of fires, which burned
350,000 acres as the largest wildfire in state history, but evidence suggests
that is likely to become the rule rather than the exception. State Department
of Ecology officials have warned that an unseasonably warm and dry winter this
year will exacerbate the spring and summer wildfire season.Regardless of the
causes, it would be disingenuous to argue that Washington is not experiencing
climate change that is resulting in higher temperatures and lower-than-normal
snowpack, creating fire-friendly conditions. As Goldmark noted in an opinion
piece last year for The Washington Post: "According to Headwaters Economics, a
nonprofit research group, twice as many acres burn and three times as many
structures are destroyed during each wildfire season as in 1990, and the season
now lasts two months longer. This trend will only get worse: Projections from
the University of Washington indicate that the average annual acreage burned by
wildfires in the Pacific Northwest will nearly double again by 2020." Last
month, Goldmark told lawmakers, "We need more firefighters and equipment to be
able to prepare for an increased chance of wildfire on both sides of the
Cascades."The questions then become: How much effort do we want to put into
suppressing wildfires? Why not let them burn? The answers: Washington's vast
forests serve a crucial ecological function. They provide habitat for wildlife,
process carbon dioxide, and offer cooling shade for streams. Plus, the
Department of Natural Resources harvests trees for timber sales that provide
revenue for the state's coffers.More important than fire suppression, lawmakers
should provide funding for wildfire prevention and for healthy forests. The
federal government has provided an abject lesson in how poor fiscal planning
can backfire, as it frequently draws from fire-prevention funds in order to
fight wildfires and creates a cycle of having to fight even larger fires the
following year. The state Department of Natural Resources has requested $20
million for forest health treatments designed to reduce the risk of
catastrophic wildfires; the proposed House budget allots $5 million, while the
Senate has paid no attention to the issue.At a time when funding for K-12
education is paramount and other issues also must be addressed, it is
understandable if lawmakers do not have wildfires high on their priority list.
But the issue is clear: They can pay for them now, or pay more for them later.

Alberta orders response review for wildfire crisis; Look at firefighting process
called 'normal' for similar emergencies

BYLINE: John Cotter, The Canadian Press

SECTION: CITY; Pg. A6

LENGTH: 405 words

DATELINE: EDMONTON


Alberta has ordered a review into how it responded to the huge wildfire known as
"The Beast" that destroyed parts of the Fort Mc-Murray region and forced close
to 90,000 people from their homes.

The government says the review will focus on how well the province was prepared
for the fire that broke out May 1 and burned almost 5,900 square kilometres.

It will also cover how the government fought the wildfire, which is no longer
growing, but is not yet under control.

"This fire has altered the lives of thousands of people who are now faced with
the difficult task of rebuilding their lives," Agriculture and Forestry Minister
Oneil Carlier said Wednesday in a news release.

"Reviews like this are a normal part of our business when faced with extreme
wildfire conditions or an extreme wildfire event."

The fire destroyed 2,400 homes and buildings, and caused the shutdown of two key
oilsands facilities. The government has issued a request for proposals to find a
contractor to conduct the review, which is to be completed by the end of the
year.

"The impact to both infrastructure and the economy will be measured in the
billions of dollars," the review document says.

The review is to include an assessment of the weather, which was unseasonably
warm, dry and windy, and how much timber and brush surrounded threatened or
burned neighbourhoods and oilsands facilities.

The review will also look at the behaviour of the fire, which spread quickly and
unpredictably.

Wildfire operations, including the number of firefighters, equipment and
aircraft that were deployed to fight the fire and how they were used, are also
to be looked at.

Carlier said the cause of the wildfire, which is being investigated by RCMP and
wildfire officials, will not be part of the review.

The Municipal Affairs Department is looking at ordering a separate review into
the evacuation of the city and the area, but no announcement has been made yet.

Similar reviews were held after the wildfire that destroyed part of the town of
Slave Lake in 2011. Those reviews led to changes in how the province works to
prevent and fight wildfires.

People have been returning to Fort McMurray and the surrounding area since June
1. Earlier this week, the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo estimated that
about half of the evacuees have come home as the community slowly works to
bounce back from the disaster. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2016 Postmedia Network Inc. All

B.C. failed to reduce wildfire risk, despite warnings

DATELINE: VANCOUVER - =


The fire in Logan Lake started like so many others in British Columbia's worst
wildfire season on record - a smouldering campfire, not fully extinguished,
sparked flames that spread across the forest floor.

But unlike other blazes that have grown catastrophically, engulfing homes,
forests and farmland, the Logan Lake fire in June was kept to a half-hectare.
The reason, a local official says, is because the town has conducted extensive
wildfire mitigation, in spite of a provincial system he describes as
under-funded, burdensome and unfair.

"Had (the fire) been in that area when we did not mitigate that area, we
would've had a severe fire on our hands," said Fire Chief Dan Leighton. "That's
proof that the work we're doing will work."

In the wake of the 2003 wildfire crisis, which destroyed more than 300 homes and
businesses, the British Columbia government asked former Manitoba premier Gary
Filmon to conduct a thorough review. In his report, Firestorm 2003, he warned
that unless action was taken to reduce fuels such as seedlings, shrubs and wood
debris in forests near communities, there would be more severe wildfires.

The province launched the strategic wildfire prevention initiative, a program
that provides funding to communities for fuel treatment. To date, the province
has provided $78 million to the initiative, a fraction of the amount spent
battling blazes or preparing for earthquakes, and less than seven per cent of
high-risk land has been treated.

This summer, the wildfire season surpassed 2003, burning 10,600 square
kilometres of land and forcing 45,000 people from their homes. The bill is $400
million and rising. The devastation has left community leaders and experts
saying the province could have done more to reduce the risk.

"The amount of fuel management to protect communities was minuscule relative to
the scale of the challenge," said Bob Simpson, Quesnel mayor and a former NDP
forestry critic in the legislature.

The province estimates about 13,470 square kilometres of forest are at high risk
of wildfires spreading into communities.

The figure is considered rough, provincial-level data and must be verified on
the ground, but it's the best estimate available. Some 923 square kilometres
have undergone fuel treatment - or just under seven per cent.

John Rustad, the forests minister prior to the B.C. Liberal government's defeat
in July after 16 years in power, said the government worked seriously with
communities to reduce fuel loads. The province expanded the community forest
program, which allows towns to harvest nearby timberlands and make them more
fire-resistant, he said.

Unfortunately, the mountain pine beetle epidemic has led to fuel buildup even in
places where work was done a decade ago, he said, adding treatment is costly and
must be done continuously.

"Could we have spent more? Obviously, hindsight is 20/20," he said. "But when
you look at the fires that came in toward Cache Creek or Ashcroft, I don't think
there would have been any strategy possible to prevent that kind of an interface
(fire) and those kinds of damages."

Madeline Maley, executive director of the B.C. Wildfire Service, said managing
wildfire risk is a shared responsibility and the province counts on local
governments and homeowners to meet the standards of a program called FireSmart.

The Forest Practices Board estimated in 2015 that the average cost of treating a
hectare of land was $10,000, although some experts put the figure at $5,000.

That means the lowest cost of treating 13,470 square kilometres would be $6.7
billion. The board said the cost per hectare could be reduced through increased
competition and incentives.

In Logan Lake, careful removal of socalled ladder fuels, including tall grasses,
shrubs and branches, is what kept the wildfire in June from growing upward and
becoming what's known as a crown fire, which leaps from treetop to treetop and
is much harder to contain.

But Leighton, the fire chief, said his frustrations with the strategic wildfire
initiative are growing. Communities are required to do the work at considerable
cost before being reimbursed, he said, adding it can take up to a year to
receive funds.

Then there's the fact that the land they are treating is Crown land surrounding
the municipality, but the province only pays for 75 per cent of the planning and
90 per cent of the treatment, he said.

"The province should be paying 100 per cent," said Leighton.

Paul Taylor, a spokesman for the Union of B.C. Municipalities, said if the
up-front cost is prohibitive for communities, they can ask to submit regular
claims to receive payments throughout the process.

The B.C. government created a forest enhancement society last year that has
received $235 million for activities including wildfire risk reduction, bringing
the total spent on mitigation, when combined with the strategic wildfire
initiative, to $313 million.

In contrast, it has spent billions preparing for a major earthquake - a worthy
use of funds, but one expert wonders why wildfires have not been made an equal
priority.

"Here we are with wildfires with severe consequences," said Lori Daniels, an
associate professor of forest and conservation sciences at the University of
British Columbia.

And unlike a major earthquake, she said, "It's not if it's going to happen in
our lifetime. It happens every summer in our lifetime."

Alberta's 'hectic' wildfire season off to blazing start; Three months in, fires
have already scorched more forest than last year

BYLINE: OTIENA ELLWAND AND ALEXANDRA ZABJEK, Edmonton Journal

SECTION: CONTEXT; Pg. A15

LENGTH: 552 words

DATELINE: EDMONTON


Alberta's wildfire season is only three months in, and already it has consumed
significantly more forest than last year.

So far this season, there have been 720 wildfires in the province, burning just
under 30,000 hectares of forest, compared to 400 fires at this time last year,
which burnt about 700 hectares.

"The actual amount of forest that's been consumed is dramatically different ...
It's been a significant increase in terms of activity," said Wildfire
Information Officer Richard Horne, adding that the majority of those fires have
been caused by humans.

The wildfire season, which began March 1, has been "very, very hectic," with
some firefighters working up to 24 days straight, said Horne.

"The forested areas of the province have been incredibly dry, so much so that
our meteorologists are talking about this being almost unprecedented," he said
at the Lesser Slave Lake Fire Centre on Wednesday.

All evacuation orders related to wildfires raging in Alberta were lifted as of
Wednesday afternoon, but 15 wildfires are still burning out of control,
including one that has been creeping toward oil and gas infrastructure near Cold
Lake, Scott Long from the Alberta Emergency Management Agency told a news
conference. Cenovus and CNRL both have operations in the area.

"There's no rain; that's the biggest concern certainly for the foreseeable
future. The conditions remain dry, and there is the possibility of further
lightning strikes in the coming days," Long said, adding that shifting winds
could further complicate the situation for fire crews.

"They're doing their best to make sure it does not impinge on any oil and gas
infrastructure."

Wildfire information manager GeoffDriscoll said the fire grew in size to about
17,000 hectares as of Wednesday, from 10,000 hectares on Tuesday. However, the
blaze remained five kilometres away from oil operations, the same distance it
was before.

As of Wednesday morning, about 250 firefighters and 10 helicopters were fighting
the blaze, which is still considered out of control and is expected to keep
growing in the days ahead. At least some of 150 extra firefighters coming to
Alberta from other provinces are expected to be deployed to the Cold Lake fire.

"We have been increasing the amount of resources at this fire each day,"
Driscoll said.

Farther west, the wildfire near Wabasca that forced the evacuation of almost
5,000 people is now "being held." Long credited "numerous and significant
perimeter guards" that firefighters have worked on over the last 72 hours on the
west, south and east sides of the fire.

The reception centres in Athabasca and Calling Lake are still open, but he said
there is a co-ordinated "re-entry" for residents. Premier Rachel Notley is
getting briefed on the wildfire threats daily.

"Of course, we're very concerned. We know that Albertans across the province are
concerned," Notley said in Calgary.

She said she was pleased to learn evacuation orders were lifted for residents.
"But we know this is a critical issue, that it requires constant attention and
oversight and that's why I've asked to be briefed every day," she said.

The Alberta government's provincial operations centre is running in Edmonton,
for the first time since the 2011 Slave Lake fire disaster. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2015

New Mexico to hire veterans to fight wildfires

BYLINE: Steve Terrell, The Santa Fe New Mexican

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 348 words


April 02--New Mexico plans to hire 40 military veterans to serve as firefighters
during the upcoming wildfire season as part of a pilot program announced Monday
by Gov. Susana Martinez's administration.

Veterans will be trained and assigned to four "hand crews" to fight wildfires
across the state. State Forestry spokesman Dan Ware said the military veterans
will be in addition to about 250 seasonal firefighters the state typically
hires.

"We are not cutting any jobs to make way for these," Ware said. Starting pay is
$17.40 an hour, and some firefighting training starts next week.

New Mexico is bracing for a possibly devastating fire season because of
lingering drought conditions. The state's wildfire season usually runs from May
to July, though the crews of military veterans could be assigned to help fight
fires outside of New Mexico after the wildfire season ends in the state.

Ware said the state will evaluate the pilot program for military veterans after
the fire season to determine whether it should be made permanent and expanded.

State prison inmates have been trained to help the State Forestry Division in
fighting wildfires since 1996.

The governor announced the program for military veterans at a news conference in
Albuquerque, where she urged New Mexicans and visitors to the state to be
vigilant about the threat of wildfires.

"Conditions are in place for another potentially difficult fire season, and I
urge all New Mexicans to take the responsibility we all have to prevent
wildfires very seriously," Martinez said in a statement.

The Little Bear Fire near Ruidoso last year became the most destructive in the
state's recorded history. It destroyed more than 250 buildings and caused more
than $22 million in damages.

There have been 59 wildfires on state and privately owned land since January,
burning about 739 acres. That's down from 68 fires that burned 2,104 acres at
the same time last year.

Wildfire smoke expected on Coast this week

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 444 words


Smoke from wildfires burning in the Interior is expected to drift down through
valleys into coastal areas on Tuesday and Wednesday (Aug. 1-2, 2017), due to a
change in weather conditions. These conditions could persist for the remainder
of this week.

Prevailing winds normally travel from the Coast to the Interior of the province.
This week, however, the winds are expected to switch into outflow conditions and
move air from the Interior to the Coast. This air will be very warm,
exceptionally dry and likely smoky.

This weather pattern will rapidly dry out coastal forests, making them more
susceptible to wildfire and making it more challenging for firefighters to put
out existing fires. Members of the public are asked to use caution with any
activity that could potentially spark a new wildfire.

The BC Wildfire Service continues to receive reports of illegal campfires and
improperly discarded cigarettes. Members of the public are urged to remain
vigilant and help prevent human-caused wildfires:

* Do not light any open fire of any size, including campfires.

* Ensure that trailers are properly maintained. Dragging sway bars, safety
chains or locked brakes can create sparks.

* Ensure that propane in recreational equipment is turned off at the tank when
travelling.

* Park or ride your motorcycle, all-terrain vehicle or any other off-road
vehicle responsibly. Avoid grass or areas where the exhaust system is close to
combustible material.

* Use an approved spark arrestor on your vehicle's exhaust system to reduce
wildfire risks.

* Take appropriate precautions with all heat sources, outdoor stoves, barbecues
and smoking materials. Always ensure that cigarette butts are properly
extinguished.

The open fire prohibitions currently in effect in the Coastal Fire Centre do not
apply to CSA-rated or ULC-rated cooking stoves that use gas, propane or
briquettes, or to a portable campfire apparatus that uses briquettes, liquid or
gaseous fuel, so long as the height of the flame is less than 15 centimetres.

To report a wildfire, columns of smoke or an open burning violation, call 1 800
663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cellphone.

Update in works for Columbia County wildfire plan

BYLINE: Dian Ver Valen, Walla Walla Union-Bulletin, Wash.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 584 words


Feb. 19--DAYTON -- Emergency planners are inviting the public to participate in
updating Columbia County's local wildfire protection plan, beginning with a 1
p.m. meeting on Tuesday in the fire station at 111 Patit Road.

A host of local agencies have already started work to revise the 2008 Community
Wildfire Protection Plan. Now they are soliciting public input to complete the
document.

"This is a whole-community approach to wildfire mitigation," said Anne Higgins
of Columbia County Emergency Management.

Participants will discuss their priorities for this plan update, focusing on
three key areas: creating fire-adapted communities, improving wildfire response
and restoring and maintaining healthy landscapes.

The plan includes action items such as buying signage for evacuations and
projects to reduce fire hazards where development meets wilderness.

Higgins said a survey her office completed of new building permits showed more
than half of those recently filed were for outside city limits.

"Some of these properties are not covered by our fire protection districts," she
said. "So part of this plan looks at mitigating the efforts needed to increase
fire protection in the county, including equipment and personnel."

The U.S. Forest Service and the Department of Natural Resources own a wide swath
of land in Columbia County, particularly in the Blue Mountains. And while these
agencies have fire protection crews, they are primarily equipped to handle
wildfires, not structure fires, Higgins said.

Local fire districts have mutual-aid agreements with these agencies and are able
to help, as they can, when structures are threatened in the Umatilla National
Forest, for example.

"But we are a small county, and our resources are very limited," she said.

This community wildfire plan helps the county and other agencies apply for
grants and other programs to help with local wildfire mitigation plans, such as
projects to help homeowners clean up debris around their rural homes and create
defensible spaces that can reduce hazard and damage in the event of fire.

The group on Tuesday will discuss which priorities from the 2008 plan have been
met, what new ones should be added, and whether some are ongoing and should
simply remain as part of the plan, Higgins said.

"We are going to have wildfires," she said. "Lightning strikes are the number
one cause of wildfires in this county. We want to make sure we do everything we
can to protect our community, but this plan is only going to work if we all work
together on it."

Agencies that have already been involved include the Forest Service and DNR, the
Columbia County Conservation District, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla
Indian Reservation, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Oregon Department of
Forestry.

Higgins hopes to have the Community Wildfire Protection Plan completed before
fire season this year. She is aiming to have a substantial amount of the
planning done by March 31 in time to plan a public hearing for the community to
review and comment on a final draft.

"We will have monthly meetings until the plan is complete," she said.

The county received a $9,000 grant from the Oregon Department of Forestry to
work on this project. That funding expires at the end of July.

National Preparedness for Wildfires Moved to Highest Level

LENGTH: 445  words

DATELINE: Washington


Office of the Doc Hastings, Committee on Natural Resources, U.S Government has
issued the following News Release:

This week the National Multi-Agency Coordinating Group raised the National
Preparedness Level to 5, its highest level indicating high fire activity with
increasing threats. The last time the National Preparedness Level was raised to
5 was July 1, 2008 and remained at this highest level for 22 days.  A raised
preparedness level indicates a high degree of wildfire activity, a major
commitment of fire resources and the probability that severe conditions will
continue for at least a few days.

This announcement comes as news outlets across the country report that the
federal government is running out of funds to fight wildfires.

"As the cost of fighting fires keeps rising, the effort is diverting funds from
other forest management programs designed to reduce fire risk. And experts say
the economic damage is being vastly underestimated in the initial headline
numbers for the fires raging through an area out West that is the size of Rhode
Island." John Schoen, "Cost of Western blazes spreads like wildfire" NBC News

"The nation's top wildfire-fighting agency was down to $50 million after
spending $967 million so far this year, Forest Service spokesman Larry Chambers
said Wednesday in an email. Chambers says the $50 million the Forest Service has
left is typically enough to pay for just a few days of fighting fires when the
nation is at its top wildfire preparedness level, which went into effect
Tuesday. There are 51 large uncontained fires burning across the nation, making
it tough to meet demands for fire crews and equipment."  AP, "Feds running out
of money to fight wildfires"

While this year's fire season has so far seen only 60% of the 10-year average of
acres burned, a significant amount of wildfire activity, is currently occurring
in several parts of the Western United States. Despite the progress of first
responders, firefighters, National Guard and Department of Defense much can
still be done to prevent damaging wildfires.

It is possible to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire through proactive,
healthy forest management and reduction of hazardous fuels. Unnatural, overgrown
and unhealthy forests increase the risk of wildfire. Active forest management
helps protect and restore forests.

Last year, wildfires burned 9.3 million acres, while the U.S. Forest Service
only harvested approximately 200,000 acres. This means that 44 times as many
acres burned as were responsibility harvested. The burned areas were not allowed
to be salvaged.

research shows a surprising trend: Over the last 40 years, California has seen a
decline in wildfires. Why is that? Researchers don't know yet but they intend to
find out.Reporter: DTEDFORDLength: 1000 wordsArt: FILE + two line charts showing
recent trends

FULL TEXT

In a year that is already being called one of the worst ever for wildfires in
the western United States, there is another fact that some might find
remarkable: For nearly 40 years, the number of wildfires in California has
declined.

California wildfire data reviewed by a USGS research ecologist shows a trend
that many could find hard to believe: Since a peak in 1980, there have been
fewer wildfires in California. This is true across the state, according to
researcher Jon Keeley, who is also a professor at UCLA.

According to his paper, co-authored with Alexandra D. Syphard, we need to
rethink our ideas about the frequency of wildfires.

"The claim commonly made in research papers and the media that fire activity is
increasing throughout the western USA is certainly an over-statement," wrote the
authors.

The trend of fewer, but not smaller, fires is apparent in recent years. State
data regarding large wildfires (300 acres or more) from 2000 to 2015 show total
numbers - not fire size - has been in decline, despite a sharp spike in 2008.

So, what's the reason for this decline? Well, they don't know yet.

"Can't say at this point what

has changed in the last 100 years that has caused this decline ... but I am
hoping we might find out," Keeley said.

Keeley has just begun to analyze the data and look for a reason, but he expects
to finish that analysis by the end of September. He also will send his research
to Calfire for review.

Keeley is confident the culprits behind the decline can be narrowed down to two
- prevention or climate - but he is reserving his judgment for now.

"Maybe fire prevention strategies or could be related to climate," Keeley said.
"My guess is they would probably like to think it is increasing efficiency in
fire prevention but remains to be seen if that is the answer at this point."

Keeley is hoping Calfire might be able to point to some specific prevention
strategies and dates it implemented to help him suss out if they had a major
impact in wildfire declines.

"We definitely have the education side," Calfire spokesman Scott McLean said.
"We spend a lot of money being proactive in trying to educate the public."

While McLean said the organization has adopted social media and other modern
tactics in recent years to better reach the public about fire prevention,
Calfire's education efforts have been happening for decades.

"There are some embarrassing programs out there with blue leisure suits and
mullets," he said.

McLean said a decline in the number of wildfires was a win for the agency's
outreach programs since the majority of wildfires are a result of human causes.

"I love to see the trend of wildfires going down," McLean said. "That means we
are getting the message out."

Despite the decline in overall fires, the number of acres burned by wildfires is
doing just the opposite.

"For most ignition sources we have found a decline in the numbers since the
1980s, but not a decline in the area burned," Keeley said.

Large wildfire numbers from 2000 to 2015 illustrate the growth in burned
acreage. While the numbers are volatile year to year, the overall trend shows
growth in fire sizes.

McLean attributes the growth in acres burned to environmental factors that have
made fires burn hotter and faster than in the past.

Despite that, he credited Calfire for its work in keeping the majority of fires
from spreading. According to Calfire data, 95 percent of fires are kept under 10
acres.

"We are constantly training. We always pay attention to what is going on, we
always investigate," he said. "We investigate what took place and we learn from
it and we make sure our firefighters learn from it."

One reason acreage could be up is from the record winter rains that replenished
fuel for fires by spawning plant growth, including the return of grass that had
disappeared from wildland areas throughout Southern California during the
drought.

Grass fires tend to burn faster and increase the number of acres burned,
according to a 2008 paper published by UC Merced Sierra Nevada Research
Institute's Anthony Westerling.

Other researchers point to climate change, but Keeley said he thinks there might
be other variables at play.

"People who have written on it tend to ascribe it to climate change, but I think
we are a long way from knowing if that is what is going on," he said.

During the past 40 years, there have been several years that have bucked the
trend of dwindling wildfire numbers, and 2017 is already well on its way to
being one of those outliers.

As of Sept. 11, Calfire has reported 5,102 wildland fires in its jurisdiction,
with nearly 230,000 acres burned.

During the same time period in 2016, there were 3,803 wildfires and 204,000
acres burned. The five-year average has been 3,872 wildland fires and 155,807
acres burned, according to Calfire.

This year is also the most expensive year for wildfires as Montana, Washington
and Oregon all have been hit by devastating blazes. As a result, U.S. Secretary
of Agriculture Sonny Purdue announced Sept. 7 that the cost of fighting fires
has exceeded $2 billion.

It has also been a record-setting year for heat in California and other western
states, according to the National Climate Report produced by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

While 2017 has been worse than predicted across western states after there were
hopes a wet winter would diminish the fire season, McLean wasn't surprised by
the numbers considering the years of drought and the fuel created by the rain
that preceded fire season.

"As a firefighter, you wake up in the morning, 'what's the weather doing,'
because that tells you what your day is going to be like," he said.

â(EURO)~Extremeâ(EURO)(TM) fire danger in Burns Lake

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 503 words


Like most of the B.C. Interior, the Northwest Fire Centre had an eventful
weekend due to wildfire activity.

A provincial state of emergency was declared last Friday. Within the boundaries
of the Northwest Fire Centre, nine new wildfires started since July 7 and all of
these fires were suspected to been caused by lightning.

As of Sunday, the B.C. Wildfire Service was responding to five new wildfires
about 32 km northeast of Granisle and 125 km northwest of Fort St. James. Four
of these wildfires covered less than one hectare each and all of them were
suspected to be caused by lightning.

The largest of the five wildfires covered about 100 hectares and did not pose a
threat to communities or structures. The fires were located west of Takla Lake,
with some of them burning on the border between the Prince George Fire Centre
and the Northwest Fire Centre.

The Northwest Fire Centre is supporting the Prince George Fire Centre's response
to these five wildfires, allowing the Prince George Fire Centre to concentrate
its resources on wildfires where life and property may be at risk.

Smoke from these fires was visible from the west side of Babine Lake, including
the community of Granisle.

As of Sunday, there were seven active wildfires in the Northwest Fire Centre,
the largest of which covered seven hectares about 41 km south of Burns Lake, two
km east of Takysie Lake. Thirty-one firefighters were working on this fire and
crews have reported good progress over the weekend. There were no structures
threatened by these fires.

Effective Monday, July 10, all open fires - including campfires - are be
prohibited throughout the Northwest Fire Centre's jurisdiction.

This prohibition will remain in effect until Oct. 21, 2017, or until the public
is otherwise notified. Anyone found in contravention of an open burning
prohibition may be issued a violation ticket for $1150, required to pay an
administrative penalty of $10,000 or, if convicted in court, fined up to
$100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail.

The Regional District of Bulkley-Nechako (RDBN) has issued three evacuation
alerts effective July 9. According to the RDBN, the alerts have been issued to
advise of the potential evacuation of the area.

All persons within this area will be given as much advance notice as possible
prior to evacuation; however, notice may be limited due to changing conditions.
These alerts affect approximately about 85 residents. The evacuation notices are
for these areas:

- The south end of Eulatazella Lake, west to Bobtail Forest Service Road, to
five km east of Little Bobtail Lake and Naltesby Lake;

- The area east of the Sutherland Forest Service Road, to two km east of Hwy.
27, north of the Nechako River to Dog CreekTrail;

- The area south of Bobtail Connector Forest Service Road, from Long Lake Forest
Service Road, to Tatuk Lake Forest Service Road, and south to the RDBN boundary.

For more information about the evacution alerts, contact the RDBN at
1-800-320-3339 or Emergency Management B.C. at 1-800-663-3456.

Wildfire in Croatan National Forest contained

BYLINE: Havelock News, N.C.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 232 words


April 02--A wildfire that began Friday night in the Croatan National Forest is
now 100 percent contained, according to officials with the U.S. Forest Service.

Fire managers will continue to monitor small pockets of smoldering embers but
believe there is very little chance of fire spreading to other areas, according
to a release issued Monday.

The fire started off Bogue Road near N.C. 24 in Newport. The cause of the
wildfire is still under investigation, according to the release.

The wildfire grew to more than 1,100 acres over the weekend. About 700 acres are
in the national forest, with about 450 acres on private land. On Saturday,
firefighters back-burned areas to control the wildfire.

Nearly 20 firefighters from the U.S. Forest Service, N.C. Forest Service,
volunteer fire departments, Department of Defense and other agencies fought the
wildfire over Easter weekend.

No injuries or property damage were reported.

Meanwhile, the forest service plans to conduct a prescribed burn today near Gray
Road just outside Havelock. The burn is designed to reduce the amount of
underbrush that could fuel a potentially dangerous wildfire while also improving
habitat for the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker and restoring the longleaf
pine ecosystem.

Minnesota DNR announces Wildfire Prevention Week

BYLINE: Staff Reports, Fergus Falls Daily Journal, Minn.

SECTION: LIFESTYLE

LENGTH: 345 words


April 18--To increase awareness of outdoor wildfire hazards, the Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources has announced that April 16-22 is Wildfire
Prevention Week. Minnesotans are asked to be thoughtful about how and when they
use fire.

Most wildfires in Minnesota occur in the spring. Last year's dry vegetation can
quickly catch fire between the time snow has melted and plants or grasses green
up. Fires escaping a debris burn is the number-one cause of wildfires. Campfires
escaping the fire ring on dry, windy days is another important cause of
wildfires.

"The DNR is already fighting wildfires thanks to the mild winter and early
spring," said Linda Gormanson, DNR burning permits coordinator. "Dead or dormant
vegetation can easily catch fire since we've had little precipitation so far
this spring."

Because escaped debris burning fires are the biggest cause of wildfires in
Minnesota, Gormanson recommends mulching or composting vegetative debris to
avoid these fires in the first place. If plans include a campfire, Gormanson
said clear the area around the campfire and keep the fire to less than 3 feet in
diameter and height. Keep a shovel and water on hand, watch the campfire
continuously and make sure it is completely out before leaving.

The DNR has initiated spring burning restrictions to reduce the number of
unintended fires. A burning permit is required to burn vegetative material
unless there is at least 3 inches of snow on the ground. The DNR or local
governments may also restrict burning if weather conditions warrant.

Visit the DNR's statewide fire danger and current burning restriction webpage
before starting a fire. Also check local weather conditions.

So far this year, 455 fires have burned 1,238 acres. On average each year,
Minnesota fire agencies respond to 1,500 wildfires that burn over 42,000 acres
at a cost of tens of millions of dollars.

SFRS in countryside appeal as high pressure raises risk of wildfires

LENGTH: 393  words


The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) is appealing to everyone in the
countryside to pay close attention to wildfire danger warnings as weather
forecasters predict dry and windy conditions in the coming days.

A high pressure system is dominating the UK's weather and this has historically
been linked to elevated wildfire behaviour at this time of year.

Whilst no specific wildfire warnings are in place forecasters have advised that
the situation, which has the potential to bring dry continental air to Scotland,
is likely to persist for the coming week.

SFRS Deputy Assistant Chief Officer Andy Coueslant, the chair of the Scottish
Wildfire Forum, said raising awareness is key to reducing the risk.

He explained: "Wildfire conditions have the potential to change markedly from
day-to-day depending on the wind direction and it's all-the-more important
people are vigilant and act responsibly while this period of high pressure
affects the country.

"Many rural and remote communities are hugely impacted by wildfires, which can
cause significant environmental and economic damage.

"Livestock, farmland, wildlife, protected woodland and sites of special
scientific interest can all be devastated by these fires, as can the lives of
people living and working in rural communities.

"Human behaviour can significantly lower the chance of a wildfire starting and
also help us to bring those that do happen under control, so it's crucial people
act safely and responsibly in rural environments and follow the countryside
code."

The public can help prevent wildfires by making sure they dispose of litter and
smoking materials carefully while in rural areas.

There are a number of things land managers can do to help prevent wildfires,
including strict adherence to the Muirburn Code, which applies to the controlled
burning of heather within the permitted season.

Further advice is available on the Your Safety section of the SFRS
website,www.firescotland.gov.uk, where links can be found to both the Muirburn
Code and the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.

Many wildfires are started deliberately or are due to careless, reckless or
irresponsible behaviour.

Anyone who sees someone acting suspiciously, recklessly or irresponsibly in the
countryside should contact Police Scotland on 101 or pass information
anonymously to Scotland Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

9,000 Driven From Their Homes; Rampant wildfires could worsen with hot dry
weather and wind

BYLINE: Cheryl Chan And Patrick Johnston, with files from The Canadian Press

SECTION: CITY; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 832 words


Raging wildfires across the B.C. Interior show no sign of abating Sunday,
forcing highway closures and chasing more residents out of their homes.

Close to 2,000 people who live in the District of 100 Mile House fled their
homes late Sunday after Mayor Mitch Campsall issued an evacuation order due to
the looming threat of a rapidly-moving wildfire.

Another 195 homes north of Princeton were also ordered to leave in a "controlled
evacuation" starting at 2 a.m. Monday when temperatures are cooler to allow safe
passage from a 1,500-hectare blaze nearby.

With hot, dry weather, strong winds and the risk of dry lightning in the
forecast, officials say the situation could get worse.

"We're at the mercy of the weather," said Kevin Skrepnek, B.C. Wildfire
Service's chief fire information officer, adding he anticipates more evacuation
orders and alerts over the coming days.

"We know this situation is going to continue to grow, but we have all the
resources available to us to make sure that we do our best to protect life and
buildings."

Ground and aircrews were fighting 220 wildfires across the province on Sunday,
many of them uncontained.

Emergency services estimate as many as 9,000 people have been driven out of
their homes.

One of the largest fires, at 4,400 hectares, is burning near Ashcroft, prompting
a slew of evacuation orders Friday and Saturday.

In the hard-hit Cariboo, about 5,000 households have been evacuated in
communities including 100 Mile House, 105 Mile, 108 Mile, 150 Mile House and the
Alexis Creek area.

The Alexis Creek Health Centre was also shut down indefinitely due to the
mandatory order.

Sixteen evacuation orders have been issued by the Cariboo Regional District
since Friday, including five on Sunday, stretching the resources of the
district's emergency operations centre thin.

The Sunday evacuations were due to the 3,200-hectare Gustafsen wildfire, the
2,500-hectare 150 Mile House wildfire, and the Wildwood fire, which has consumed
2,000 hectares near the Williams Lake airport. None of these wildfires are
contained.

"The fire situation continues to be very difficult with fires that are very
challenging to actually attack because of the intensity and nature of the fire
activity," said Skrepnek.

There have been several structures destroyed in the blazes, but authorities say
they do not have an accurate estimate of the extent of the damage due to smoky
conditions and because crews are currently focused on protecting people and key
infrastructure, such as roads, hydro lines and people's homes.

Outgoing Premier Christy Clark was in Kamloops Sunday to announce the
government's commitment to provide $100 million to help communities and
residents affected by the wildfires.

Evacuees registered with the Red Cross can immediately access $600 via
electronic transfer.

"We are just, in many ways, at the beginning of the worst part of the fire
season and we watch the weather, we watch the wind, and we pray for rain," said
Clark.

"But our prayers aren't always answered in these things and so we need to be
there to support people in the meantime because there are hundreds and hundreds
of people who are scared to death right now."

Premier-designate John Horgan said he would honour the $100 million Clark had
committed to, adding that the province would likely provide even more support as
the cost of the disaster grows.

"Whatever is needed to make sure that people are whole after this, we're going
to make sure that happens," he said, after meeting with officials in Kamloops.

Horgan said he spoke with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Sunday afternoon, who
assured him the federal government stood ready to help.

"To have the prime minister say the federal government is there for us when we
need it is very reassuring," he said.

Public safety minister Ralph Goodale said Sunday he has approved a request for
federal assistance.

Defence minister Harjit Sajjan added the Canadian military is ready to respond
to the B.C. government's request for help.

The province has been marshalling all the personnel it can to battle the flames,
protect property and try to keep people safe.

More than 1,000 firefighters are on scene, supported by heavy equipment and
helicopters.

Another 600 personnel are backing them up, plus some 200 contractors, and an
additional 260 firefighters are being recruited from other parts of Canada.

Karen Klassen, who lives in the outskirts of Williams Lake, off Highway 97, is
anxiously watching the fires burning in the distance.

There has been no evacuation order in her neighbourhood, so she's staying put at
home after stocking up on emergency supplies and preparing a "go bag" on Friday.

A visit to Williams Lake that day was eerie, she said, with long lines at the
gas station and empty shelves in the grocery stores. "It was very surreal. It
was like a disaster movie and I was in it." chchan@postmedia.com
